Exercise prescription involves careful screening including history and physical examination to determine a patient's capacity for physical activity as well as their risk factors and goals. This course introduces the science and theory of exercise prescription in the continuum of care. An overall goal of the course is to provide the foundational basis for understanding the body's physiological responses to physical activity as well as understand the acute responses and chronic physiologic adaptations to physical activity, including some of the static and dynamic factors ('moderating variables') that influence such responses and adaptations. Students will be introduced to cardiorespiratory, strength, and mobility testing, exercise prescription, and special population considerations. Clinical correlations and case-study applications will be used throughout the course."

Students will learn how to: 1) determine the statistical conclusion of research evidence for practice, 2) provide the logic of hypothesis testing, and 3) utilize specific statistical tests used for the descriptive and inferential analysis of experimental research data. Epidemiological statistics that enhance the understanding of diagnostic tests and treatment options will also be covered and the analytical components of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Students will read research literature weekly and participate in a critical appraisal of the selected research methods and the meaningfulness of the findings for clinical decisions."

Course facilitators and lecturers will guide students in provocative conversations around health disparities, structural competency, bias, and the impact of implicit associations on interactions with peers and patients. Through skills building exercises and experiential opportunities, students will be challenged to explore individual, cultural, and social determinants of health and wellness. In addition, students will gain knowledge about the evidence and economics of health disparities, the Durham community, and the history of Duke Medicine's role in that community. Through the evaluation of peer-reviewed literature regarding health disparities, students will gather knowledge and skills to mitigate provider influences on disparities and ultimately improve the quality of healthcare."

This course will build upon earlier foundational and STEPs experiences to further develop clinical reasoning. During CAMP II, students will be mentored by DPT program faculty and physical therapists as they work in small groups on applied skills pertinent to patient case management including examination and interventions including progressions. The students in this course will be involved in developing and documenting a plan of care based on the ICF model that includes goals, skilled intervention, and progression."

Students will be provided opportunities to develop real-world skills to address disparities at the interpersonal and community levels. This content is offered during the DPT second year as a continuation of the first-year CDHD I and II courses to drive the clinical application of skills and offer opportunities for direct engagement. The course is offered in parallel with our integrated clinical experiences in CAMP to solidify our learners' abilities to grapple with these complex issues. The expectation is that learners will enter their summative third-year terminal clinical experiences competently prepared to identify and reduce healthcare disparities."

In addition, students engage in online learning resources throughout the TCE course series. During the clinical experiences, one or more selected and trained clinical instructors (CIs) will supervise students as they learn skills in all components of the physical therapy practice management model, including conducting patient examinations and evaluations, establishing patient diagnoses and prognoses, conducting patient interventions, and measuring patient outcomes. When possible, students will engage patients in practice patterns across the range of acute to chronic conditions. Students will participate in administrative aspects of ethical and efficacious practice. Performance expectations will include progression in level of independence in demonstrating competent, proficient, safe and effective examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention and professional practice skills."

    "catalog_description": "The US has been an attractive and desirable destination for many internationally educated physical therapists for decades, and although internationally trained physical therapists are often well trained and skilled, they frequently do not have the background or knowledge of the nuances and unique complexities that exist within the US health care systems, and the multiple roles that physical therapists can and do perform along the continuum of care. A better understanding of these complexities, and creating opportunities to discussion and debates, can improve the probability of success as the internationally educated clinician transition towards licensure within the US, and would also promote a welcoming environment for further growth for internationally educated physical therapists in our country. As such, we propose an on-line course that we have titled 'Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States: A Course for Internationally Educated Physical Therapists.' The main objective of this course is to provide foundational knowledge of the complexities and nuances of US-based physical therapy policy, practice and regulation that are critical to moving forward towards licensure and effective practice in the US. Credit: 2."
