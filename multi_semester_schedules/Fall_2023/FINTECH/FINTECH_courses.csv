3838,FINTECH,502,01,FinTech Capstone,"This course is a culmination of the FinTech program and will focus on developing solutions to a real world problem. For example, sufficient retirement income is an increasingly pressing problem in the United States and most developed countries given growth in retirement age, health care cost and quality, with corresponding longevity of the population. In order to obtain solutions that are economically and operationally feasible there is a need to understand, through forecasting techniques, the probable outcomes, with an eye towards both sides of the balance sheet. This will ensure that solutions created do not operate in a vacuum that fails to account for Global economic environment.",,3,LEC,E,Engineering Professional,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/08/2025,04/23/2025,Open,60,33,27,0,60,Graded,N,John P Fimbel
