8033,NURSING,990,01,Nurse-led Models of Care Addressing Social Determinants of Health,"Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the single greatest driver of health inequities. Conceptual and theoretical frameworks that operationalize relationships between SDOH and health are critical for guiding research that promotes health equity. This course will explore novel conceptual models and methodological approaches that serve to guide the development, testing, and implementation of nurse-led models of care focused on addressing the SDOHs. Topics will include theories and models, such as those focused on relationships of power and social structures that produce inequalities; worldviews that consider epistemological views of health; and innovative methods to evaluate nurse-led models of care. Nurse-led models of care exist in a broad social context and can provide vehicles for promoting health equity.
