The primary goal is to provide a rich experience in the discipline of surgery while introducing students to the practice and principles of surgery. The objectives of this course are satisfied in a variety of ways. Students are actively incorporated into the surgical services. Students are divided into two groups, one at Duke University and the other at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, and each works with Duke Surgical residents and members of the surgical faculty in the traditional surgical disciplines and surgical specialties. Students are assigned patients on the surgical wards where they serve a crucial role in the care, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of their patients. Clinical rounds are made daily and provide real-time patient care experience and instruction. The fundamental topics which form the foundation of surgical practice are presented at bi-weekly seminars with presentations by senior staff of the Duke University Department of Surgery. The subjects discussed include a broad range of topics in general, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery in addition to the surgical specialties encompassing neurosurgery, orthopaedics, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, and urology/ Students are also given an opportunity to re-inforce their knowledge of anatomy and physiology. These fundamental principles are discussed during dissections of fresh tissue performed in the Duke University of Surgery Fresh Tissue Laboratory. Students are also given an opportunity to test their hand eye coordination in the Surgical Education and Activities Lab. The entire experience is consolidated during various sessions in experimental surgery, during which each student serves as the anesthesiologist, first assistant, and operating surgeon in performance of surgical procedures on experimental animals.

Students are part of the Surgical Critical Care team. Students present on rounds, participate in didactic sessions, and experience direct patient care exposure in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) setting. Students will be able to learn from attendings, fellows, residents, PA/NPs, and other ancillary staff. Usual shifts are 6am-6pm including signout. Students are advised to experience night call during the selective in order to maximize one's experience. Please plan on attending fellow lectures, journal club, critical care grand rounds, and other opportunities during your time in the SICU. Credit: 1. Enrollment Max. 3. Location: DMP - 6W, SICU- 6:00 a.m. Please report to the resident at the computer stations on the high-numbered side of the SICU for sign out at 6:00am. The fellow and attendings rotate weekly and will help facilitate your first day. For more information and to confirm meeting location and time, please contact: Dr. Cory Vatsaas via email, cory.vatsaas@duke.edu.

Students will be exposed to common diagnostic scenarios, pre- and post-operative patient care, extensive technical skill training, surgical anatomy, wound management, and how to interpret surgical literature critically. This course will also feature mock pages to challenge students to respond to common surgical scenarios. It includes two full days performing surgery in the vivarium on porcine models under resident and attending guidance. The Department of Surgery fully funds this course with housestaff and faculty serving as instructors throughout the two weeks. Students will receive a welcome email detailing the schedule and locations including where to meet on the first day of classes. The course will be offered during spring section 44. Permission is required for enrollment. The contact for obtaining a permission number during registration for spring 2026, will be determined by fall 2025. When the contact person is updated for 2026, you will need to provide them with the following information: name, email address, cell phone number and wireless company, (e.g. Verizon, AT&T, etc.) - needed for the mock pages, and include what residency you applied for or will apply for (e.g. general surgery, urology, etc.) Credit: 2.

The students are involved in patient care with a specific surgeon but, in addition, are expected to attend multidisciplinary conferences related to the disease site of interest that week. These multidisciplinary conferences involve medical and radiation oncology as well as surgical oncology. The student is also expected to evaluate surgical patients in an outpatient setting as well as participating in inpatient and operative patient care. There is no overnight call responsibility.

Four weeks are spent in the SICU at Duke University Medical Center (trauma, vascular surgery, liver-kidney-pancreas transplantation, general surgery, surgical subspecialties, MICU and NICU overflow). There is emphasis on teaching of procedures and techniques necessary for the management of all critically ill patients including hemodynamic assessment and monitoring, cardiovascular resuscitation and use of vasoactive drugs, ventilator management including ARDS, prevention and management of nosocomial infections, and nutritional support. Students are formally evaluated by the SICU house staff and the attending physician. For more information, please contact Dr. Cory Vatsaas at 684-3636 or via email, cory.vatsaas@duke.edu.

The course emphasizes both triage and resuscitation for major and minor emergency problems in the Emergency Department and also pre- and postoperative care on the Inpatient Trauma Service. There are opportunities to enhance the student's education by participating with the acute care surgery service, emergency general surgery consultation, and coverage of acute care general surgery operations. The student has a full-time experience by assuming duties and responsibilities similar to a sub-intern. Emphasis is placed on developing skills in the care of patients with multi-system injuries in the Emergency Department, Inpatient Service, and Operating Room. Students work in conjunction with the attending staff, residents on the Trauma Service, and our advanced practice providers. Students will typically spend three weeks covering daytime trauma service obligations and one week of night coverage to maximize your education and experience. For more information, please contact Dr. Cory Vatsaas at 684-3636 or via email at cory.vatsaas@duke.edu. Additional information can be obtained by the Trauma Chief, who is the senior resident on the service, pager 970-9995. Students should meet in the General Surgery Resident bunker/lounge on the 3rd floor DMP across from the DMP OR entrance at 6:00 a.m. on the first day of the rotation. Credit: 4. Enrollment: max 3.
