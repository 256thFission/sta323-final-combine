4004,CMAC,252,01,Learning to Fail,"Most people spend their lives afraid of failing. Yet, many of the world's most successful people failed numerous times on their paths toward success. The underlying question of this class is if failing is as antithetical to learning as we're taught to believe. To explore this question, we will test ways of using failure as a strategy for learning. We will experiment with failure to learn how it can make us better as we develop our skills as innovators, specifically focusing on the earliest stage of creativity: ideation. We will use failure through experimentation as a technique for problem definition and needs discovery which, in turn, will help us validate the quality of our ideas.",,1,LEC,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/08/2025,04/23/2025,Closed,18,21,0,0,18,Graded,Y,Aaron Philip Dinin
