7182,CBB,511,01,Journal Club,A weekly series of discussions led by students that focus on current topics in computational biology. Topics of discussion may come from recent or seminal publications in computational biology or from research interests currently being pursued by students. First and second year CBB doctoral and certificate students are strongly encouraged to attend as well as any student interested in learning more about the new field of computational biology,,1,LEC,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/08/2025,04/16/2025,Open,20,15,5,0,20,Graded,N,-; -; -; -; Elizabeth Hauser
6123,CBB,526,01,Data Science,"Data science is 'the science of planning for, acquisition, management, analysis of, and inference from data'. This course systematically covers the concepts, ideas, tools, and example applications of data science in an end-to-end manner. We emphasize data-driven thinking, data processing and analytics, and extracting actionable values from data. We focus on the interactions between data and applications, data modeling, and data processing, data analytics, and the essential algorithms and tools. Prerequisites: A statistics course (Statistics 111 or higher), data structures and algorithms (Computer Science 201), and relational databases (Computer Science216 or 316).",,3,LEC,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/08/2025,04/16/2025,Open,40,28,12,0,40,Graded,Y,Tananun Songdechakraiwut
