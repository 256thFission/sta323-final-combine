1003,MEDICINE,205C,81,Medicine,"During the second-year clerkship in medicine, students each will be assigned for six weeks to a team taking care of patients on the Internal Medicine Wards at Duke University Hospital, Duke Regional Hospital, or the Durham Veterans Administration Hospital. The Internal Medicine Clerkship is an opportunity for the student to consolidate knowledge from the first year and apply it to patient care. Functioning within teams allows students to observe, practice, acquire, and refine basic humanistic and clinical skills while acquiring some of the factual information used in the practice of medicine. Students are assigned patients to evaluate and follow; these patients become representative learning experiences in a case-study model. Goals of the Medicine clerkship are to teach a method of patient evaluation and care and to provide a firm foundation in medical problem-solving that will be helpful throughout the student's future career. Students are expected to take primary responsibility for the care of their patients, following them daily, writing progress notes in the chart, keeping track of what has happened to their patients since last seen, and having a good understanding of the rationale for and outcomes of all diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions. Methods of assessment include clinical evaluations by residents and attendings, a clinical performance exam, ECG interpretation exam, online case-based examination, and the NBME Medicine shelf exam.

If students need to miss more than 1 day of the rotation, they will need to drop the course at least 10 days prior to the start date to allow time for other learners to have an opportunity to enroll. All absences must be approved by the course director (Dr. Neha Kayastha) before the start of your rotation.

(2) How Goals Are Achieved: Under supervision of a Hematology/Oncology fellow and a division staff member, the student is given considerable responsibility in the care of inpatients on one of the Hematology/Oncology or Experimental Therapeutics wards in Duke Hospital. They receive instruction and guidance in performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and gain experience in the use of chemotherapeutic drug regimens. Specific issues such as quality of life, care of the aging patient with malignancy, and decisions regarding DNR status are addressed by the patient-care team. In addition, students receive a series of core lectures, receive training in chemotherapy, and attend the ongoing clinical, research and didactic divisional conferences. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by their preceptors on the basis of their ability to obtain a history, perform a physical examination, evaluate hematologic and other laboratory data, and propose assessments and plans of action.

We will require you to attend in-person for AT LEAST 4 of the 8 sessions. The rest you can attend virtually. This hybrid format permits a larger class size. Also, many students are traveling during the course and this format can accommodate your travels more easily. You will need a working computer/tablet/smartphone and internet access to participate in the course. We do allow one unexcused absence. Excused absences will need to be cleared by the Course director. Classes will be held on Wednesday evenings from 5:30p - 7:30p. Credit: 1. Minimum Enrollment: min: 8; max: 40.

The student is expected to read standard texts regarding their patients' problems, as well as relevant reviews provided by the attending physician. The student may also interact with the Anticoagulation Management Service to gain a better understanding of various approaches to outpatient management of anticoagulant therapy. Students electing to do an eight-week rotation have a more extensive laboratory and clinic research experience. (3) Methods of Evaluation: The student's performance is evaluated by the hematology attending with input from the fellow and/or medicine resident on the service. The evaluation is based on observation of the student's ability to do careful histories and physical examinations, to appropriately assess the problem and develop a logical diagnostic and therapeutic plan, and to demonstrate an increase in knowledge regarding laboratory tests and their application to clinic problems.

The students will be able to work-up and present cases to Fellows and Faculty and attend multiple conferences that occur each week (Journal Clubs, Grand Rounds and Case Conferences). The basic principles of Infection Management and Antibiotic Stewardship will be taught by Fellow and/or Attending Physician and this education should provide a platform to utilize during house officer training and care in most medical and surgical specialties. The teaching methods will be: case presentations, rounding daily on the Infectious Diseases Service, Didactic teaching sessions on core topic areas in Infectious Diseases, attending Clinical Microbiology Rounds, and attending Infectious Diseases Conferences. This course strives to allow the student to appreciate the clinical 'thought processes and principles around diagnosis and management of Infectious Diseases'. Grading criteria are subjective and the direct responsibility of the individual attending physician on the service. There are no objective tests to support the grade. The student is encouraged to be involved and attempt to learn as much as possible. This enthusiasm for learning is the expectation of Fellows and Faculty for the student. The feedback for students may be gathered by direct interaction with the attending physician. NOTE: This elective may require students to complete some rotations at the VA Medical Center. Please note that you must complete the required VA paperwork no later than 30 days from the 1st day of your scheduled class in order to participate.
