Despite this importance, we know far less about the oceans than terrestrial environments. This course provides an overview of why the oceans matter, including the many ways people use and depend on the oceans. We will discuss the major issues that threaten our oceans, and students will explore emerging solutions to these challenges of changing ocean use using market-based, scientific, and policy approaches.
