2799,CMB,631,01,Contemporary Topics in Membrane Biology,"This course will highlight modern topics regarding biological membranes and membrane proteins that are important for human physiology and disease. Topics include structure and dynamics of biological membranes, structure and function of membrane proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling, diseases related to dysfunction of membrane and membrane proteins, and current efforts on drug discovery. Major techniques used in membrane research will also be covered. The format will be a combination of lectures and discussion of primary literature. Students will be evaluated based on their class participation and performance at the final presentations. Reserved for graduate students; open to undergraduate students by instructor permission.",,2,LEC,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,02/24/2025,04/16/2025,Open,18,15,3,0,18,Graded,Y,Seok-Yong Lee
2807,CMB,720,01,Modern Techniques in Cell and Molecular Biology,"The course will introduce students to current techniques in six areas including light microscopy, mass spectrometry, genomics, cell biology, genetic engineering and advanced cell culture. Each area will provide an overview of key experimental approaches and will present examples of data acquisition, analysis and interpretation that will be complemented with problem solving and/or in-depth review by the students.",,3,LEC,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/08/2025,04/16/2025,Closed,25,31,0,0,25,Graded,N,Michel Bagnat
