The musicians helping Ellington were largely hidden: the goal was to establish the image of him as a genius composer who did it all by himself. The Beatles, in contrast, carefully cultivated the image of an egalitarian musical collective; they were so successful that this ideal came to dominate rock during the 1960s.",,1,SEM,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/07/2026,04/22/2026,Open,14,8,6,0,14,Graded,Y,Thomas Brothers
