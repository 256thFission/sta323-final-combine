We also look at Picasso and Braque, Dutch workshops in the seventeenth century, Hip Hop, architectural studios, Charles Dickens, T.S. Eliot, Warhol, and movies. Along the way we'll learn about jazz and rock during the period 1920 through 1970. The ethics of collaboration plays out very differently in these two ensembles. The musicians helping Ellington were largely hidden: the goal was to establish the image of him as a genius composer who did it all by himself. The Beatles, in contrast, carefully cultivated the image of an egalitarian musical collective; they were so successful that this ideal came to dominate rock during the 1960s.",,1,SEM,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/07/2026,04/22/2026,Open,14,8,6,0,14,Graded,Y,Thomas Brothers

Thus, we will skip that task in this course and focus on the history and current implications of the ideas and institutions that have shaped the world since around the eighteenth century. Some of these ideas and institutions include industrialization and mass society; capitalism and socialism; sovereignty, the modern state, and its powers; disenchantment and secularism; colonization, decolonization, and neocolonialism; democracy and authoritarianism; consumerism and surveillance capitalism; and environmental destruction.

This course invites you to rethink politics as a creative, relational force—a constantly shifting system of human ordering that is contingent, artificial, and open to reinvention. Combining embodied practices, speculative thought, and theory, this seminar explores how socio-political ideologies inscribe themselves in our bodies and behaviors. Through play, experimentation, and reflection, we will design and deconstruct systems, examine individual agency within larger frameworks, and imagine new relational possibilities.

Links ethics to ethos (beliefs, aspirations, and spirit of a community or culture) to suggest that policies are not only pragmatic guidelines for decision-making and action, but also fundamental declarations concerning the character of human flourishing and the shape of the natural world, which is why environmental policies are often so contentious.
