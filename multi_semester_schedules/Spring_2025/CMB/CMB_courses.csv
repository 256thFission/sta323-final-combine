6017,CMB,512S,01,Weird Model Organisms in Today's Evolutionary Cell Biology,"How and why are new organisms being developed as emerging models in cell biology? Through lectures and reading primary literature, we'll learn how traditional model organisms (E. coli, yeast, fruit flies, mice, etc.) were originally developed and how 'weird' organisms from across the Tree of Life are used to address questions ranging from human health to climate change. Guest speakers, early-stage biologists from various fields (e.g., academia, industry, government agency) and backgrounds, will share with us how their choice of model organisms impacted their research and career. Develop skills in critical reading, scientific presentation, discussion, and developing research proposals. Recommended prerequisite: Biology 201L, 202L and one additional Biology course, or graduate student standing.",,3,SEM,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/07/2026,04/15/2026,Open,15,7,8,0,15,Graded,Y,Masayuki Onishi
3099,CMB,631,01,Contemporary Topics in Membrane Biology,"This course will highlight modern topics regarding biological membranes and membrane proteins that are important for human physiology and disease. Topics include structure and dynamics of biological membranes, structure and function of membrane proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling, diseases related to dysfunction of membrane and membrane proteins, and current efforts on drug discovery. Major techniques used in membrane research will also be covered. The format will be a combination of lectures and discussion of primary literature. Students will be evaluated based on their class participation and performance at the final presentations. Reserved for graduate students; open to undergraduate students by instructor permission.",,2,LEC,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,02/23/2026,04/15/2026,Open,18,10,8,0,18,Graded,Y,Seok-Yong Lee
3057,CMB,720,01,Modern Techniques in Cell and Molecular Biology,"The course will introduce students to current techniques in six areas including light microscopy, mass spectrometry, genomics, cell biology, genetic engineering and advanced cell culture. Each area will provide an overview of key experimental approaches and will present examples of data acquisition, analysis and interpretation that will be complemented with problem solving and/or in-depth review by the students.",,3,LEC,E,Graduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/07/2026,04/15/2026,Open,25,23,2,0,25,Graded,N,Michel Bagnat
