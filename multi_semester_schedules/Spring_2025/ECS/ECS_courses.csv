The structure of these flow paths and exchange surfaces reflects evolutionary adaptations that balance the tradeoff under prevailing environmental constraints. This framework allows predicting with reasonable accuracy how climate variation influences the tradeoff and, consequently, tree function. At the forest ecosystem scale, responses become more complex and are additionally shaped by biogeochemical interactions among plants, microorganisms, and insects.
