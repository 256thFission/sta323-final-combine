When possible, students will engage patients in practice patterns across the range of acute to chronic conditions. Students will participate in administrative aspects of ethical and efficacious practice. Performance expectations will include progression in level of independence in demonstrating competent, proficient, safe and effective examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention and professional practice skills.",,12,LEC,E,Physical Therapy - Doctorate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Physical Therapy-3rd year,01/05/2026,04/10/2026,Open,108,103,5,0,0,"Pass, Fail, Incomplete Grading",N,-; Jamie L Greco

9611,PT-D,901,01,"Foreign Educated PT Course (FEPT-C): Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States","The US has been an attractive and desirable destination for many internationally educated physical therapists for decades, and although internationally trained physical therapists are often well trained and skilled, they frequently do not have the background or knowledge of the nuances and unique complexities that exist within the US health care systems, and the multiple roles that physical therapists can and do perform along the continuum of care. A better understanding of these complexities, and creating opportunities to discussion and debates, can improve the probability of success as the internationally educated clinician transition towards licensure within the US, and would also promote a welcoming environment for further growth for internationally educated physical therapists in our country. As such, we propose an on-line course that we have titled 'Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States: A Course for Internationally Educated Physical Therapists.' The main objective of this course is to provide foundational knowledge of the complexities and nuances of US-based physical therapy policy, practice and regulation that are critical to moving forward towards licensure and effective practice in the US.
