Exercise prescription involves careful screening including history and physical examination to determine a patient's capacity for physical activity as well as their risk factors and goals. This course introduces the science and theory of exercise prescription in the continuum of care. An overall goal of the course is to provide the foundational basis for understanding the body's physiological responses to physical activity as well as understand the acute responses and chronic physiologic adaptations to physical activity, including some of the static and dynamic factors ('moderating variables') that influence such responses and adaptations. Students will be introduced to cardiorespiratory, strength, and mobility testing, exercise prescription, and special population considerations. Clinical correlations and case-study applications will be used throughout the course."

The didactic portion of the course provides the background to make evidence-based clinical decisions in examination, evaluation, and treatment of patients with a wide variety of cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions. The practicum portion focuses on the integration of these decision-making capabilities with the necessary psychomotor skills required for the examination and treatment of patients with cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions."

Students will learn how to: 1) determine the statistical conclusion of research evidence for practice, 2) provide the logic of hypothesis testing, and 3) utilize specific statistical tests used for the descriptive and inferential analysis of experimental research data. Epidemiological statistics that enhance the understanding of diagnostic tests and treatment options will also be covered and the analytical components of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Students will read research literature weekly and participate in a critical appraisal of the selected research methods and the meaningfulness of the findings for clinical decisions."

Learners are introduced to orthoses and orthotic prescription based on clinical exam findings. Clinical skills in management of individuals with limb loss and limb difference are learned with a focus on a biopsychosocial approach to care. Learners are exposed to prosthetic componentry and how to interact and collaborate with prosthetists and orthotists to best treat the needs of patients/clients. Basic wheelchair seating and mobility content includes patient/client evaluation and prescription of equipment to improve mobility and meet an individual's personal needs. Throughout this course we interact with peer mentors, community volunteers, and assistive technology end-users to better understand the role of the physical therapist in using technology to improve function of our patients/clients."

Learners will apply examination procedures to identify impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions and develop a plan of care for adults with neurological dysfunction. Learners will differentiate between central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system dysfunction based on clinical characteristics, apply advanced skills in examination and task analysis to distinguish typical from pathological responses, and develop evidence-informed intervention strategies. The course series will emphasize diagnosis-specific examination and evaluation techniques, PT diagnoses, pharmacological management of neurological conditions, clinical decision-making, prognosis, standardized assessments, outcome measures, and interventions. Diagnoses highlighted in Foundational Neuro Practice I will include Stroke, Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Management across the lifespan and in various clinical settings will be addressed."

This course will provide a comprehensive survey of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the central and peripheral nervous systems, which will provide a framework for understanding the form and function of the neuronal systems in the brain and spinal cord that motivate bodily actions and behaviors. Learners will command comprehensive knowledge concerning the form and function of the nervous system, and the means by which the nervous system governs human behavior. Through this course, learners will gain the foundational knowledge to understand how neuroanatomy and neurophysiology impact the care of patients/clients in the profession of physical therapy."

In this course, learners will develop the professional behaviors, knowledge, and values crucial to be leaders in a dynamic health care environment. Through an understanding of the profession's history and governance, students will have experiences in professional and patient advocacy initiatives. Students will master the crucial skills of patient and professional communication in order to operate effectively in practice. Students will also be grounded in ethical frameworks that can be easily applied to practical situations encountered in clinical practice. This course series seeks to develop leadership skills necessary to be change agents in healthcare practice, management, education, research, and advocacy."

This course will build upon earlier foundational and STEPs experiences to further develop clinical reasoning. During CAMP II, students will be mentored by DPT program faculty and physical therapists as they work in small groups on applied skills pertinent to patient case management including examination and interventions including progressions. The students in this course will be involved in developing and documenting a plan of care based on the ICF model that includes goals, skilled intervention, and progression."

Students will be provided opportunities to develop real-world skills to address disparities at the interpersonal and community levels. This content is offered during the DPT second year as a continuation of the first-year CDHD I and II courses to drive the clinical application of skills and offer opportunities for direct engagement. The course is offered in parallel with our integrated clinical experiences in CAMP to solidify our learners' abilities to grapple with these complex issues. The expectation is that learners will enter their summative third-year terminal clinical experiences competently prepared to identify and reduce healthcare disparities."

When possible, students will engage patients in practice patterns across the range of acute to chronic conditions. Students will participate in administrative aspects of ethical and efficacious practice. Performance expectations will include progression in level of independence in demonstrating competent, proficient, safe and effective examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention and professional practice skills."

    "catalog_description": "The US has been an attractive and desirable destination for many internationally educated physical therapists for decades, and although internationally trained physical therapists are often well trained and skilled, they frequently do not have the background or knowledge of the nuances and unique complexities that exist within the US health care systems, and the multiple roles that physical therapists can and do perform along the continuum of care. A better understanding of these complexities, and creating opportunities to discussion and debates, can improve the probability of success as the internationally educated clinician transition towards licensure within the US, and would also promote a welcoming environment for further growth for internationally educated physical therapists in our country. As such, we propose an on-line course that we have titled 'Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States: A Course for Internationally Educated Physical Therapists.' The main objective of this course is to provide foundational knowledge of the complexities and nuances of US-based physical therapy policy, practice and regulation that are critical to moving forward towards licensure and effective practice in the US. Credit: 2."
