They reflect on how personal and organizational missions and values inform communication style. Students work through brand crisis scenarios, building media response skills and considering the ethics of shaping public perception. The course culminates in a visual press kit and strategic plan that showcase students' ability to communicate with purpose and bring innovative ideas to brand messaging."

We also look at Picasso and Braque, Dutch workshops in the seventeenth century, Hip Hop, architectural studios, Charles Dickens, T.S. Eliot, Warhol, and movies. Along the way we'll learn about jazz and rock during the period 1920 through 1970. The ethics of collaboration plays out very differently in these two ensembles. The musicians helping Ellington were largely hidden: the goal was to establish the image of him as a genius composer who did it all by himself. The Beatles, in contrast, carefully cultivated the image of an egalitarian musical collective; they were so successful that this ideal came to dominate rock during the 1960s."

In addition to policy questions in these areas, we examine leadership practices in arts organizations and cultural institutions, with particular attention to the kinds of leadership the arts require in a post-2020 world. Students will work in teams on a semester-long collaborative project with an arts policy organization and experience the arts in practice through attendance at performances and exhibitions."

However, thanks to the Internet, you can build a global audience from your dorm room. This class explores how. Learn about social media, search engine optimization, virality, content marketing, growth hacking, and other digital audience building strategies. They're difficult to learn and time consuming to execute, so expect to struggle. We'll learn as much from our failures as we will from our successes as we discover what it takes to cultivate global awareness for an idea without ever leaving Durham."

You've surely heard the platforms described as 'revolutionary,' and you've also heard them described as 'time wasters.' What you probably haven't thought about is how similar they are to previous 'revolutionary' communications technologies like novels, newspapers, and even language itself. This course explores ways in which studying the masters of previous 'social' media technologies—the Shakespeares, Whitmans, and Eliots of the world—can help us understand how influencers on digital social media leverage the same platforms you use every day to market themselves, build their brands, and grow their audiences."

Product managers must understand diverse cultures and customers. Concepts covered include needs finding, ethical product development, market opportunity analysis, strategy, road mapping, competitive analysis, and life cycle management. Learning takes place using a mix of individual and team-based assignments, presentations, and projects."

But a host of these disruptors are cutting out the middleman while redefining brick-and-mortar retail. Amazon now gets us whatever we want, whenever and wherever we want it. Dollar Shave Club quickly amassed 3 million subscribers. These 'direct-to-consumer' brands control every customer interaction. These brands become as much about that experience as about the product itself. This requires customer empathy. Armed with these insights, we can create brands that reframe peoples' category expectations and, in best cases, enhance their lives."

For the service-learning component, students volunteer at least 20 hours during the semester at nonprofit organizations engaged in the pursuit of social justice. This experience provides an opportunity to observe, participate in and reflect on the day-to-day implementation of social action, policy and organizing initiatives. As part of the volunteer commitment and in lieu of a final paper, students produce a documentary media project that communicates goals identified by and in collaboration with the community partner."

    "catalog_description": "Graduate students often have expertise in particular domains, but little business experience. Attaining business experience can take years and is often hard to navigate. Using entrepreneurship as a backdrop, this course provides a broad overview of business, including practical business fundamentals and theoretical frameworks for critical thinking. The course achieves this through theoretical frameworks, experiential education, and an analysis of competing companies. Students will experience the early stages of a typical startup, examine theoretical basis for startup success, understand managing and operating within an organization, and conduct a business analysis of competing companies."
