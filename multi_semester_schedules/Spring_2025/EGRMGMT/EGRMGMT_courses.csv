In addition, students flesh out this framework through project-based assignments and presentations applying the principles of design thinking, human factors, design for usability, and interaction design to analyze, create, and present effective customer experience solutions.",MEM ONLINE STUDENTS,3,LEC,E,Engineering Professional,Asynchronous Online,Duke University,Online,Regular Academic Session,01/07/2026,04/22/2026,Open,4,0,4,0,4,Graded,N,Greg Twiss
2655,EGRMGMT,579,01,Using Real-Time Data to Improve Customer Quality Experience,"This class is designed to help students understand what it takes to improve customer experience using data. Emphasis is placed on the collection and use of real-time data for transforming customer experience. Key topics covered include the customer experience life cycle, data management and types, data collection infrastructure, use of metrics to create insights, using python for data science, creation of machine learning algorithms to predict customer impacting events and using data to support the customer success business model. Finally, the class provides exposure to current industry practices, case studies, a comprehensive final project and industry guest speakers.",,3,LEC,E,Engineering Professional,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,01/07/2026,04/22/2026,Open,30,16,14,0,30,Graded,N,Luis E Morales

Learning about human visual perception, in particular the science of how choice of color, form, and other design elements can assist pre-attentive information processing. Origins of modern data-visualization in the pre-computer age are considered, starting with the use of overlay maps, and Galton's Quincunx and Correlation Diagram. Students learn to recognize the most commonly utilized types of data-visualization metaphor, as well as rules of thumb for various types of data analysis.
