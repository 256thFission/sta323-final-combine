5755,PHYSICS,556,01,Stellar Astrophysics,"This course surveys the key physics of stellar structure, interiors, and evolution. The focus is on the essential concepts for understanding dynamical processes in stars, the relevant equations and their approximate solutions. Topics include: timescales, scaling relations, equations of state, radiative transfer, convection, nuclear reactions and rates, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and supernovae. We will aim throughout the course to impart a better physical and intuitive understanding of the essential meaning of the equations, processes, and principles that govern stars of all sort, and of their universality. The intended audience is graduate students and upper-level undergraduates.
