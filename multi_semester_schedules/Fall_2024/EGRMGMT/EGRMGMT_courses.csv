Objectives of the course are to: i) Introduce students to the functional area of operations and to increase their awareness of how a firm's operations interface with the other functional areas of the organization, ii) Familiarize students with the various issues and problems that traditionally arise in the management of operations within both manufacturing and service organizations, iii) Acquaint students with some of the terminology, modeling, and methodologies that often arise in the handling and resolution of operations issues and problem.",MEM ONLINE STUDENTS,3,LEC,E,Engineering Professional,Asynchronous Online,Duke University,Online,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/02/2025,Open,25,9,16,0,25,Graded,N,Pranab Majumder

It introduces students to five different business personas that play a key role in the software life cycle: customer, software engineer, software release/quality manager, customer support engineer, and general manager. For each of these players, it reviews what they do and what is most critical to quality. The class also provides exposure to current industry practices, case studies, data analysis and guest speakers who can describe 'what a day in the life' of each of these personas looks like.",,3,LEC,E,Engineering Professional,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Open,30,2,28,0,30,Graded,N,Luis E Morales

Still other designs resonate in the marketplace to such an extent that they become household names. Design team leaders confront a dizzying array of priorities, many dictated by industry standards as well as legal requirements that protect health, safety, and even civil rights. Through case studies and primary sources, this course explores the multifaceted challenges that confront design thinkers and innovators as well as strategies for managers and their teams to support the pursuit of excellence in the design process.",,3,LEC,E,Engineering Professional,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Open,45,37,8,0,45,Graded,N,Seth A.
