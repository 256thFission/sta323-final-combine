    "catalog_description": "Palliative care focuses on helping patients and their families achieve the best quality of life, regardless of the length of life. Attention to suffering, excellent symptom management, and compassionate communication skills are paramount. This 1 week (Monday-Friday), 1-credit selective provides students the opportunity to observe and work alongside various palliative care practitioners in community, inpatient, outpatient and hospice settings. The importance of multi-disciplinary teamwork will be emphasized. Concepts to be explored include common fears and challenges that terminally ill people face, biopsychosocial models of care, palliative care symptom management, the family interface, grief, and bereavement. You will arrive at your assigned site at 8:30AM on the first day; a personalized schedule with further details will be sent to you by email prior to the first day. \nAttendance/Absence Policy: This is a 5-day rotation and students are required to be present with the team a minimum of 4 days (90% of the course) in order to make the most of the rotation and to ensure that our clinicians are able to appropriately assess and grade the learning experience. If students need to miss more than 1 day of the rotation, they will need to drop the course at least 10 days prior to the start date to allow time for other learners to have an opportunity to enroll. All absences must be approved by the course director (Dr. Neha Kayastha) before the start of your rotation. Any absence without prior notification of the course director is considered unexcused unless documentation of inability to make those contacts is provided. Any absence not approved by the course director for a required part of a course is considered unexcused. An unexcused absence will have a negative impact on the student's grade or evaluation and may result in a Code of Professional Conduct charge if deemed unprofessional behavior. A pattern of unexcused absences will result in an unsatisfactory grade.\nPermission of the instructor is required in order to register for this course. Email Jennifer Bowen (jennifer.bowen@duke,edu) in order to request a permission number. \nAdd/Drop: Students are asked to email the course director, Dr. Neha Kayastha (neha.kayastha@duke.edu) and the educational admin Jennifer Bowen (jennifer.bowen@duke.edu) if/when you add or drop the course.\nFor more information, contact the course director Dr. Neha Kayastha and the educational admin Jennifer Bowen via email at neha.kayastha@duke.edu and jennifer.bowen@duke.edu.\nCredit: 1.

Attention to suffering, excellent symptom management, and compassionate communication skills are paramount. This 1 week (Monday-Friday), 1-credit selective provides students the opportunity to observe and work alongside various palliative care practitioners in community, inpatient, outpatient and hospice settings. The importance of multi-disciplinary teamwork will be emphasized. Concepts to be explored include common fears and challenges that terminally ill people face, biopsychosocial models of care, palliative care symptom management, the family interface, grief, and bereavement. You will arrive at your assigned site at 8:30AM on the first day; a personalized schedule with further details will be sent to you by email prior to the first day. \nAttendance/Absence Policy: This is a 5-day rotation and students are required to be present with the team a minimum of 4 days (90% of the course) in order to make the most of the rotation and to ensure that our clinicians are able to appropriately assess and grade the learning experience. If students need to miss more than 1 day of the rotation, they will need to drop the course at least 10 days prior to the start date to allow time for other learners to have an opportunity to enroll. All absences must be approved by the course director (Dr. Neha Kayastha) before the start of your rotation. Any absence without prior notification of the course director is considered unexcused unless documentation of inability to make those contacts is provided. Any absence not approved by the course director for a required part of a course is considered unexcused. An unexcused absence will have a negative impact on the student's grade or evaluation and may result in a Code of Professional Conduct charge if deemed unprofessional behavior. A pattern of unexcused absences will result in an unsatisfactory grade.\nPermission of the instructor is required in order to register for this course. Email Jennifer Bowen (jennifer.bowen@duke,edu) in order to request a permission number. \nAdd/Drop: Students are asked to email the course director, Dr. Neha Kayastha (neha.kayastha@duke.edu) and the educational admin Jennifer Bowen (jennifer.bowen@duke.edu) if/when you add or drop the course.\nFor more information, contact the course director Dr. Neha Kayastha and the educational admin Jennifer Bowen via email at neha.kayastha@duke.edu and jennifer.bowen@duke.edu.\nCredit: 1.

Overnight duty consisting of night float responsibilities may be included over the course of the four-week schedule. The supervising resident or attending determines the number of patients assigned with anticipated increases over the four weeks. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by their residents, fellows, and attendings. The evaluation form is made available to each student at the beginning of the rotation. Prerequisites: permission of instructor is required in order to add the course and permission is required in order to drop the course. In order to drop the course, students must provide at least 14 days advanced notice and permission of instructor is required.

The student learns to interpret peripheral blood films, how to use and interpret other specialized laboratory tests (e.g., bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, serum electrophoresis, coagulation studies, tumor markers, leukemia cell markers), and how to approach the evaluation and treatment of hematologic and solid tissue malignancies and their complications. (2) How Goals Are Achieved: Under supervision of a Hematology/Oncology fellow and a division staff member, the student is given considerable responsibility in the care of inpatients on one of the Hematology/Oncology or Experimental Therapeutics wards in Duke Hospital. They receive instruction and guidance in performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and gain experience in the use of chemotherapeutic drug regimens. Specific issues such as quality of life, care of the aging patient with malignancy, and decisions regarding DNR status are addressed by the patient-care team. In addition, students receive a series of core lectures, receive training in chemotherapy, and attend the ongoing clinical, research and didactic divisional conferences. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by their preceptors on the basis of their ability to obtain a history, perform a physical examination, evaluate hematologic and other laboratory data, and propose assessments and plans of action.

The student learns to interpret peripheral blood films, how to use and interpret other specialized laboratory tests (e.g., bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, serum electrophoresis, coagulation studies, tumor markers, leukemia cell markers), and how to approach the evaluation and treatment of hematologic and solid tissue malignancies and their complications. (2) How Goals Are Achieved: Under supervision of a Hematology/Oncology fellow and a division staff member, the student is given considerable responsibility in the care of inpatients on one of the Hematology/Oncology or Experimental Therapeutics wards in Duke Hospital. They receive instruction and guidance in performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and gain experience in the use of chemotherapeutic drug regimens. Specific issues such as quality of life, care of the aging patient with malignancy, and decisions regarding DNR status are addressed by the patient-care team. In addition, students receive a series of core lectures, receive training in chemotherapy, and attend the ongoing clinical, research and didactic divisional conferences. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by their preceptors on the basis of their ability to obtain a history, perform a physical examination, evaluate hematologic and other laboratory data, and propose assessments and plans of action.

Students participating in this four-week elective based in Duke Hospital are expected to function at intern-level, assuming care of a small census of complex patients. The Medicine/Psychiatry faculty on the GenMed 12 service provides direct supervision. The goal of the elective is to refine and then clinically apply basic knowledge from the fields of Internal Medicine and Psychiatry. Participation at selected case conferences and didactic sessions is expected. Students are invited to attend the intern lecture series during Psychiatry Academic Half-day and educational offerings in Internal Medicine, including Intern Report. For more information, please contact Dr. Kristen Shirey via email, kristen.shirey@duke.edu; secondary contact: Cathy Lefebvre, cathy.lefebvre@duke.edu. Preference is given to students considering a career in combined Medicine-Psychiatry. Prerequisite: permission of instructor and successful completion of PSYCHTRY-205C and MEDICINE-205C.

    "catalog_description": "The rotation is best suited for students interested in pursuing a career in primary care or internal medicine due to the faster pace of clinic. Course Goals: At the end of the experience, students should be able to 1) Diagnose and manage a number of common internal medicine and primary care problems including a wide variety of diseases that are generally seen only in the ambulatory setting 2) Be familiar with current USPSTF guidelines for preventive services and cancer screening, 3) Competently and efficiently take a problem-focused history, perform a directed physical exam and perform some office-based procedures. How Goals Are Achieved: The student will work with faculty preceptors within Duke Primary Care, Duke Outpatient Clinic, and other community-based offices spending one or more days per week seeing patients with a preceptor. The student with see patients at multiple different sites with multiple preceptors. Clinical sites are located both at Duke and in the surrounding communities. A diverse mix of patients and conditions are seen in the outpatient setting. Patients present for preventive services, as well as, management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, osteoporosis, and common mental health conditions. In addition, patients are seen for acute illnesses such as pneumonia, pharyngitis, sinusitis and urinary tract infections on a same day basis. Patients routinely present with symptoms that have not been previously evaluated or diagnosed, allowing students to truly sharpen their clinical skills. The student evaluates selected patients first then presents and discusses the case with the attending. The student must outline in writing five goals that he or she wishes to accomplish during this rotation. The student's goals should be emailed to Dr. Waite at least three weeks before the rotation begins. Methods of Evaluation: The faculty preceptor who works directly with the student does the student evaluation. Grades are based on the student's interactions with patients, his or her clinical thinking regarding diagnosis and management of their problems, and documented records. Professionalism, fund of knowledge, and commitment to learning are highly weighted. Prerequisites: Students must be enrolled in their fourth year of medical school at Duke and must have completed first, second, and third year requirements as demonstrated by advancement by the Promotions Committee to fourth year student status. Students must have access to the Duke Maestro Care computer system to effectively function in clinic. Permission required for enrollment. Students must contact Dr. Kathleen Waite via email (waite001@mc.duke.edu) to determine time and location for initial meeting. They must also contact Dr. Waite in advance of the course start date to create goals and schedule. Dr. Waite can also be reached by phone at 919-619-2642. Credit: 1 (10 clinic sessions, 4 hours each session over a four-week block) or 2 (20 clinic sessions, 4 hours over a four-week block). Due to scheduling issues if in not possible to complete this elective in a 1- or 2-week period of time. Please note that this is a 1 or 2 credits only. Enrollment: max 1 student for 2 credits. Kathleen Waite, MD; Ranee Chatterjee, MD; Chris Fink MD, Denise Pong MD, Kevin Shah, MD; and other outpatient faculty"

Course Goals: At the end of the experience, students should be able to 1) Diagnose and manage a number of common internal medicine and primary care problems including a wide variety of diseases that are generally seen only in the ambulatory setting 2) Be familiar with current USPSTF guidelines for preventive services and cancer screening, 3) Competently and efficiently take a problem-focused history, perform a directed physical exam and perform some office-based procedures. How Goals Are Achieved: The student will work with faculty preceptors within Duke Primary Care, Duke Outpatient Clinic, and other community-based offices spending one or more days per week seeing patients with a preceptor. The student with see patients at multiple different sites with multiple preceptors. Clinical sites are located both at Duke and in the surrounding communities. A diverse mix of patients and conditions are seen in the outpatient setting. Patients present for preventive services, as well as, management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, osteoporosis, and common mental health conditions. In addition, patients are seen for acute illnesses such as pneumonia, pharyngitis, sinusitis and urinary tract infections on a same day basis. Patients routinely present with symptoms that have not been previously evaluated or diagnosed, allowing students to truly sharpen their clinical skills. The student evaluates selected patients first then presents and discusses the case with the attending. The student must outline in writing five goals that he or she wishes to accomplish during this rotation. The student's goals should be emailed to Dr. Waite at least three weeks before the rotation begins. Methods of Evaluation: The faculty preceptor who works directly with the student does the student evaluation. Grades are based on the student's interactions with patients, his or her clinical thinking regarding diagnosis and management of their problems, and documented records. Professionalism, fund of knowledge, and commitment to learning are highly weighted. Prerequisites: Students must be enrolled in their fourth year of medical school at Duke and must have completed first, second, and third year requirements as demonstrated by advancement by the Promotions Committee to fourth year student status. Students must have access to the Duke Maestro Care computer system to effectively function in clinic. Permission required for enrollment. Students must contact Dr. Kathleen Waite via email (waite001@mc.duke.edu) to determine time and location for initial meeting. They must also contact Dr. Waite in advance of the course start date to create goals and schedule. Dr. Waite can also be reached by phone at 919-619-2642. Credit: 1 (10 clinic sessions, 4 hours each session over a four-week block) or 2 (20 clinic sessions, 4 hours over a four-week block). Due to scheduling issues if in not possible to complete this elective in a 1- or 2-week period of time. Please note that this is a 1 or 2 credits only. Enrollment: max 1 student for 2 credits.

    "catalog_description": "(1) Course Goals: For students to learn the basics of the evaluation and management of patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory arthritis, autoimmune and immunological disorders. Diseases seen include the various forms of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases such as lupus and other connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, scleroderma, and myositis. Students will also learn to interpret specialized laboratory studies relating to the evaluation of patients with rheumatic and immunological disorders. Students are exposed to joint aspiration and injection, synovial fluid analysis, musculoskeletal radiology, and histopathological analysis. (2) How Goals Are Achieved: Two weeks of the rotation are spent in the Duke Rheumatology faculty clinics located in Duke South Clinics and in our South Durham or Brier Creek (Raleigh) locations. Two weeks are spent as part of the rounding team on the Duke Hospital inpatient rheumatology consultation service. The inpatient consultation team includes an attending physician, a fellow, a student and possibly 1 resident. Students are expected to perform at least three new inpatient consultations each week. Rounds focus on oral presentation of patients including detailed review of history, physical examination findings, pertinent laboratory, x-ray and pathological findings. Students attend divisional conferences including weekly Rheumatology and Immunology Grand Rounds, Rheumatology Fellows Core Curriculum Conference, Journal Club, and Rheumatology/Radiology Conference. Students are expected to watch two introductory videos, one on the approach to the rheumatology patient and one on the rheumatologic musculoskeletal examination. Justification for a grade of honors includes the following: Evidence through direct observation of house officer-level clinical skills in rheumatology; evidence of timely completion of learning modules, demonstrated by 1) active participation in and preparation for weekly meetings and 2) completion of the log of learning points and questions; 3) attendance at conferences listed above; 4) evidence of additional reading through case presentations to faculty members; 5) faculty evaluations; 6) demonstration of exemplary interest and effort during the rotation. Students are assigned primary house officer level responsibilities on the Consultation Service and the Outpatient Clinics at Duke South/South/Durham/Brier Creek. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by the primary faculty and fellows with whom they work. Evaluations are based on students' performance on rounds and in the clinics, including history and physical examination skills and conference attendance.

The student learns to evaluate clinical coagulation disorders and become familiar with coagulation laboratory testing and interpretation. Secondary - To expose the student to recent advances in the area of coagulation research. (2) How Goals Are Achieved: The student spends four weeks on the Hematology Consult Service under the direction of hematology division faculty. The student is expected to work up inpatients with coagulation problems referred to the Coagulation Service as well as participate in a half day a week Coagulation Outpatient Clinic. Patients generally present with complex diagnostic as well as therapeutic problems. The rotation includes Coagulation lab rounds during which the student learns to interpret lab tests and review abnormal results. The student is expected to read standard texts regarding their patients' problems, as well as relevant reviews provided by the attending physician. The student may also interact with the Anticoagulation Management Service to gain a better understanding of various approaches to outpatient management of anticoagulant therapy. Students electing to do an eight-week rotation have a more extensive laboratory and clinic research experience. (3) Methods of Evaluation: The student's performance is evaluated by the hematology attending with input from the fellow and/or medicine resident on the service. The evaluation is based on observation of the student's ability to do careful histories and physical examinations, to appropriately assess the problem and develop a logical diagnostic and therapeutic plan, and to demonstrate an increase in knowledge regarding laboratory tests and their application to clinic problems.

    "catalog_description": "Hospice and Palliative Medicine is a specialty that is focused on the treatment of patients living with serious illness. Comprehensive care, including physical (primarily symptom management), psychological, and spiritual care, is provided by an interdisciplinary team to patients and families to help alleviate suffering and promote quality of life. This 2-week (Monday-Friday), 2-credit elective provides students the opportunity to observe and work alongside palliative care practitioners in inpatient settings including the palliative care consult services at Duke University Hospital and Duke Regional Hospital, as well as inpatient hospice exposure through Duke Home Care & Hospice. The importance of interdisciplinary teamwork will be emphasized. You will arrive at your assigned site at 8:30AM on the first day; a personalized schedule with further details will be sent to you by email prior to the first day. \n Attendance/Absence Policy: This is a 10-day rotation and students are required to be present with the team a minimum of 9 days (90% of the course) in order to make the most of the rotation and to ensure that our clinicians are able to appropriately assess and grade the learning experience. If students need to miss more than 2 days of the rotation they will need to drop the course at least 10 days prior to the start date to allow time for other learners to have an opportunity to enroll. All absences must be approved by the course director (Dr. Neha Kayastha) before the start of your rotation. Any absence without prior notification of the course director is considered unexcused unless documentation of inability to make those contacts is provided. Any absence not approved by the course director for a required part of a course is considered unexcused. An unexcused absence will have a negative impact on the student's grade or evaluation and may result in a Code of Professional Conduct charge if deemed unprofessional behavior. A pattern of unexcused absences will result in an unsatisfactory grade.\n\nPermission of the instructor is required for enrollment. A special permission number will be required to register for this course. Please email Jennifer.bowen@duke.edu to obtain the special permission number. Once you are registered for the course, please email jennifer.bowen@duke.edu to request your preferred 2 weeks during the 4 week block (either the first 2 weeks or the second 2 weeks of the block). Jennifer will confirm the 2 weeks that are assigned to you via email (the preferred 2 weeks goes to the person who requests it first). NOTE: Students must also notify the course director and/or Jennifer Bowen if they drop the course. \n For more information, contact the course director Dr. Neha Kayastha and the educational admin Jennifer Bowen via email at neha.kayastha@duke.edu and jennifer.bowen@duke.edu.

Comprehensive care, including physical (primarily symptom management), psychological, and spiritual care, is provided by an interdisciplinary team to patients and families to help alleviate suffering and promote quality of life. This 2-week (Monday-Friday), 2-credit elective provides students the opportunity to observe and work alongside palliative care practitioners in inpatient settings including the palliative care consult services at Duke University Hospital and Duke Regional Hospital, as well as inpatient hospice exposure through Duke Home Care & Hospice. The importance of interdisciplinary teamwork will be emphasized. You will arrive at your assigned site at 8:30AM on the first day; a personalized schedule with further details will be sent to you by email prior to the first day. \n Attendance/Absence Policy: This is a 10-day rotation and students are required to be present with the team a minimum of 9 days (90% of the course) in order to make the most of the rotation and to ensure that our clinicians are able to appropriately assess and grade the learning experience. If students need to miss more than 2 days of the rotation they will need to drop the course at least 10 days prior to the start date to allow time for other learners to have an opportunity to enroll. All absences must be approved by the course director (Dr. Neha Kayastha) before the start of your rotation. Any absence without prior notification of the course director is considered unexcused unless documentation of inability to make those contacts is provided. Any absence not approved by the course director for a required part of a course is considered unexcused. An unexcused absence will have a negative impact on the student's grade or evaluation and may result in a Code of Professional Conduct charge if deemed unprofessional behavior. A pattern of unexcused absences will result in an unsatisfactory grade.\n\nPermission of the instructor is required for enrollment. A special permission number will be required to register for this course. Please email Jennifer.bowen@duke.edu to obtain the special permission number. Once you are registered for the course, please email jennifer.bowen@duke.edu to request your preferred 2 weeks during the 4 week block (either the first 2 weeks or the second 2 weeks of the block). Jennifer will confirm the 2 weeks that are assigned to you via email (the preferred 2 weeks goes to the person who requests it first). NOTE: Students must also notify the course director and/or Jennifer Bowen if they drop the course. \n For more information, contact the course director Dr. Neha Kayastha and the educational admin Jennifer Bowen via email at neha.kayastha@duke.edu and jennifer.bowen@duke.edu.

Secondary - The student learns basic principles of hormone physiology and applies these concepts in clinical settings. (2) How Goals Are Achieved: Each student is introduced to patient problems by working with the Endocrine faculty. The student is exposed to clinical endocrine disorders by seeing patients in endocrine outpatient clinics (Diabetes/ General Endocrine, and Durham VA Medical Center General Endocrine Clinics), as well as experiencing the inpatient Diabetes Management/General Endocrine Consult Service. The student has the opportunity to review general literature on common endocrinologic conditions and endocrinologic emergencies, as well as learning basic assessment skills of the patient with diabetes, thyroid disease, and other common endocrinologic presentations. Division conferences include Grand Rounds, Case Conference, and Inpatient Consult Rounds with opportunities to integrate basic concepts with clinical applications. (3) Methods of Evaluation: A written critique is provided by the student's preceptors with comments from other members of the division as appropriate.

Issues such as quality of life and care of the geriatric oncology patient are addressed. (2) How Goals Are Achieved: The student is assigned several preceptors in the Hematology/Oncology clinic for five full days per week during a four-week block. If desired, preceptors who concentrate mainly on hematology or oncology may be arranged. 3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by their preceptors on the basis of their ability to obtain a history, perform a physical examination, evaluate hematologic and other laboratory data, and propose assessments and plans of action. NOTE: Students cannot drop the course 2 weeks prior to the course start date. Credit: 4. Enrollment: max 1. Matthew Labriola, MD, and Hematology, Medical Oncology and Cell Therapy staff"

Clinical duties include the performance of inpatient consults under the supervision of a fellow and staff member. This course may be taken for four weeks.

(2) How Goals Are Achieved: Students receive a series of core lectures, gain familiarity with chemotherapy regimens and administration, and attend the ongoing clinical, research, and didactic divisional conferences. Clinical duties include the performance of inpatient consults under the supervision of a fellow and staff member. This course may be taken for four weeks. (3) Methods of Evaluation: The students are expected to perform and present initial evaluations of consult cases including peripheral blood film on daily rounds, and to perform limited literature searches and evaluations of chosen clinical topics.Credit: 4.

(1) Course Goals: Primary - To provide students with an in-depth exposure to the diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias, electrophysiologic studies, ablation of arrhythmias, cardiac pacemakers, and implantable defibrillators; to help students to understand the electrophysiologic events that result in arrhythmias and ECG changes. Special emphasis will be placed on ECG interpretation. This course is not designed to be a substitute for the general cardiology elective (MEDICINE 404C and 445C). Secondary - To familiarize the student with certain basic techniques of arrhythmia diagnosis; (2) How Goals Are Achieved: The student spends four weeks working on the Clinical Arrhythmia Service. The student makes rounds on the inpatient Clinical Electrophysiology Service on patients with arrhythmias. The student is encouraged to attend electrophysiologic studies and assist in the analysis of data from these studies. Attendance at electrophysiologic surgical procedures is also encouraged. The student is responsible for the work-up of patients admitted to the Arrhythmia Service as well as inpatient consultations, and plays an important role in the follow-up of these patients while they are in the hospital. The student may elect to see outpatients during Arrhythmia Clinics that meet on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in the PDC (Duke Clinic). The student assists in the evaluation of patients for permanent pacemaker and defibrillator implantation. Students are responsible for reviewing the literature on subjects related to the patients that they have seen on the clinical service. Didactic conferences are given on Monday and Wednesday mornings; (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated on their clinical skills in taking histories, performing physical examinations, interpretation of the ECG as well as in their assessment and presentation of the patient's problem to the attending physicians. They are encouraged to present at least one patient each day. They are also assessed on their ability to read and understand the relevant literature and their ability to assume a responsible role in the care of patients on the Clinical Arrhythmia Service. Students should meet at Conference Room 7451A Duke North Hospital at 7:30 a.m. and page Dr. Grant (970-6656) if he is not there shortly after 7:30 a.m. STUDENTS MUST CHECK IN WITH DR.

(2) How Goals Are Achieved: Students are assigned to the consult service at either the Durham VA Center or Duke, where, in concert with the resident, fellow and senior staff attending, they evaluate the operative risk for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery as well as make decisions concerning the evaluation and treatment of patients with a wide variety of heart diseases. Students participate in reading ECGs and a core curriculum experience including individually assigned times to work with HARVEY, the cardiology patient simulator, and various computer assisted instruction programs. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by the resident, fellow, and senior staff with whom they work. The evaluation form is made available at the beginning of the elective. Depending on circumstances, students may also be evaluated by written and practical examinations at the beginning and/or end of the elective.

    "catalog_description": "(1) Course Goals: Primary - To refine and further develop the skills necessary for eliciting an accurate, complete CV history and for performing an accurate, complete CV physical examination: To refine student understanding of normal and pathologic cardiovascular physiology while functioning in the role of a consultant for inpatients and outpatients with various cardiovascular problems; Secondary - to develop the skills necessary to quickly and accurately interpret ECGs (both 12-lead ECGs and rhythm strips). (2) How Goals Are Achieved: Students are assigned to the consult service at either the Durham VA Center or Duke, where, in concert with the resident, fellow and senior staff attending, they evaluate the operative risk for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery as well as make decisions concerning the evaluation and treatment of patients with a wide variety of heart diseases. Students participate in reading ECGs and a core curriculum experience including individually assigned times to work with HARVEY, the cardiology patient simulator, and various computer assisted instruction programs. (3) Methods of Evaluation: Students are evaluated by the resident, fellow, and senior staff with whom they work. The evaluation form is made available at the beginning of the elective. Depending on circumstances, students may also be evaluated by written and practical examinations at the beginning and/or end of the elective. NOTE: Students enrolled in this course may be required to complete their rotation at the DVAMC. The required paperwork for the DVAMC must be completed at least 30 days prior to the first day of classes for the section/term the student is enrolled. Contact the department to obtain required paperwork. For more information, please contact Dawne Smith, 668-1524 or via email at dawne.t.smith@duke.edu. Prerequisite: none. Credit: 4. Enrollment: max. 5, (unless otherwise noted). Nishant Shah, MD; and cardiology staff"

This class will consider these questions using a variety of sources from 20th century American medicine including medical memoirs, patient narratives, short stories, and other media. We will identify the critical historical processes (scientific, social, and cultural) that account for the structure of medical practice today, as well as examine the ethical tensions and controversies that have resulted. Priority given to MS3 students and Armstrong Humanities Scholars; class may be taken individually or as part of longitudinal MS3 medical humanities sequence. Location to report on the first day: Conference Room, Trent Center for Bioethics, Humanities, and History of Medicine, Room 108 Seeley G Mudd Building (Medical Center Library). Classes will meet on Wednesday evenings 5:15 to 7:15. Permission of instructor is required for enrollment - students must obtain permission number from the course director. Third Year students must also obtain email approval from their mentor. The email approval from the mentor should be sent to thirdyear@dm.duke.edu and the course director (jeffrey.baker@duke.edu). Enrollment Max.: 14; Enrollment Min.: 8. Credit: 1, Non-Direct Patient Care credit. Offered during fall section 82. Jeffrey P. Baker, MD/PhD"
