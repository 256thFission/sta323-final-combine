PM&R physicians are known as physiatrists. Physiatrists focus on a holistic, patient-centered approach to care, focusing on how to improve a patient's function utilizing therapies, pharmacology equipment, etc. Physiatrists often lead interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams and work closely with neurologists, psychiatrists, orthopedic/neurological surgeons, either in close coordination or as members of multi-disciplinary clinics. Thus, students who participate in this selective will take part in a collaborative practice, build on their medical knowledge, and develop basic understanding of the nuances of these conditions from the perspective of the recovery and rehabilitation process. The students will also gain insights about the specialty of PM&R for the consideration of this specialty for their career. The time and location of the first day of the selective will be decided through the communication with the course director, Dr. Ankit Patel (ankit.patel@duke.edu). The class meets M-F, 8am - 5pm. Students attend Grand Rounds on Wednesday from 6:30am - 7:30am (in person or virtually). Permission is required. Students must contact Dr. Patel prior to registering and/or course information.

PM&R physicians are known as physiatrists. Physiatrists focus on a holistic, patient-centered approach to care, focusing on how to improve a patient's function utilizing therapies, pharmacology equipment, etc. Physiatrists often lead interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams and work closely with neurologists, psychiatrists, orthopedic/neurological surgeons, either in close coordination or as members of multi-disciplinary clinics. Thus, students who participate in this selective will take part in a collaborative practice, build on their medical knowledge, and develop basic understanding of the nuances of these conditions from the perspective of the recovery and rehabilitation process. The students will also gain insights about the specialty of PM&R for the consideration of this specialty for their career. The time and location of the first day of the selective will be decided through the communication with the course director, Dr. Ankit Patel (ankit.patel@duke.edu). The class meets M-F, 8am - 5pm. Students attend Grand Rounds on Wednesday from 6:30am - 7:30am (in person or virtually). Permission is required. Students must contact Dr. Patel prior to registering and/or course information.

PM&R physicians are known as physiatrists. Physiatrists focus on a holistic, patient-centered approach to care, focusing on how to improve a patient's function utilizing therapies, pharmacology equipment, etc. Physiatrists often lead interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams and work closely with neurologists, psychiatrists, orthopedic/neurological surgeons, either in close coordination or as members of multi-disciplinary clinics. Thus, students who participate in this selective will take part in a collaborative practice, build on their medical knowledge, and develop basic understanding of the nuances of these conditions from the perspective of the recovery and rehabilitation process. The students will also gain insights about the specialty of PM&R for the consideration of this specialty for their career. The time and location of the first day of the selective will be decided through the communication with the course director, Dr. Ankit Patel (ankit.patel@duke.edu). The class meets M-F, 8am - 5pm. Students attend Grand Rounds on Wednesday from 6:30am - 7:30am (in person or virtually). Permission is required. Students must contact Dr. Patel prior to registering and/or course information.

PM&R is the medical specialty that focuses on treating patients with physical disabilities, whether it be from stroke, sports injury, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or congenital/acquired musculoskeletal conditions. PM&R physicians are known as physiatrists. Physiatrists focus on a holistic approach to healthcare, focusing on how to improve a patient's function and manage their pain. Physiatrists often lead interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams and work closely with neurologists, psychiatrists, orthopedic/neurological surgeons. The students will have the opportunities of rotating with the physiatry attendings seeing patients and performing procedures in the areas of interventional spine, MSK, pediatric physiatry, prosthetics and orthotics, physical therapy/occupational therapy, chiropractic therapy, etc. For questions or permission, please contact Dr. H Michael Guo, (h.michael.Guo@duke.edu).
