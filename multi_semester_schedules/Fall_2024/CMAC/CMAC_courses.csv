3082,CMAC,110S,01,"Intro to Digital Culture: Media Theory, Politics, Aesthetics","What is digital culture today? In the 90s digital culture studied how the internet transformed our interactions. In the 00s digital culture is driven by social media platforms (from youtube to tiktok), data profiling and recommendation algorithms. We visit iconic places through our constantly updating city apps. Our identity profiles are fashioned by social media influencers. We match with new friends and become followers. We know that biases of race, class, gender and sexuality are internal to search algorithms. Everyday decisions, behaviours, and desires are linked to our smart media. This course explores how digital media affect our subjectivity, our body, social and collective actions, political power and control.",,1,SEM,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Open,18,17,1,0,18,Graded,Y,Luciana Parisi; -

We will experiment with failure to learn how it can make us better as we develop our skills as innovators, specifically focusing on the earliest stage of creativity: ideation.
