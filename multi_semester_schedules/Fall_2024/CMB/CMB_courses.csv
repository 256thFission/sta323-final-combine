6396,CMB,525S,01,Proteomics Methods in Life Sciences,"Proteins are the main molecular effectors driving cellular physiology. Cells differ in the nature of proteins being expressed, in their function, location, modifications, and fate. Thus, new technologies have been developed to study the cellular proteome in the omics era. Bio525S will provide an overview of current proteomics methods used to analyze and evaluate the complexity of the cellular proteome. This overview will be centered on discussing primary literature that employs a variety of mass spectrometry-based methods to understand protein dynamics.
