The semester culminates with a pitch on the startup idea that will be further vetted in Design Climate II (spring). Through this process, students learn directly from industry professionals and cultivate capabilities in Design Thinking, entrepreneurship, project management, sustainable product development, climate fundamentals, and business competencies.
