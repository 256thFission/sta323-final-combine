3747,MGM,120FS,01,Ethical Implications of Genetic and Genomic Research,"This course will examine the ethical implications raised by genetic and genomic research. Students will gain an understanding of the historical basis of human subjects' protections in the United States, the ethical pillars of research, and the issues that arise from genetics and genomics research. Case studies in genomics research will be used to illustrate various ethical implications. Readings will consist of reviews of the history of human subjects' protections, federal regulations, actual informed consent documents, and scientific papers from the primary literature. Open only to students in the Focus Program. Instructor consent required.",,1,SEM,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Closed,18,18,0,0,10,Graded,Y,Susanne B Haga
3745,MGM,222FS,01,Genetics and Epigenetics: The Codes that Control Our Genomes,"Many inherited cellular and physiological traits in humans are not due to changes in DNA sequence, but instead are shaped by factors such as age, diet, or environment. This course will examine sequence-independent regulation of the human genome, non-genetic diseases, environmental factors that control the epigenome, and multi-generational inheritance of epigenetic information (how grandparental experiences shape descendants' genomes). Course readings will be drawn from the primary literature (historical and current) and will be anchored on human genetics, although model systems (yeast, Drosophila, plants) will also be discussed. Only open to students in the Focus Program. Department consent required.
