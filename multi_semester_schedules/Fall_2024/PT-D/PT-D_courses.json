The course emphasis is on the gross anatomy of the body. We will explore the relationships between the musculoskeletal, neurological, and vascular systems of the human body, including a critical examination of the morphology and function of the axial skeleton, upper and lower limbs, and cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, urogenital, reproductive, and neuronal systems. This course covers the biomechanics of various organ tissues, and the response of muscle, bone, joints, and soft tissue to disease and injury pertinent to the practice of physical therapy. This course will provide an introduction to the neuroanatomy of the central nervous system. Learners will command knowledge regarding how the nervous system governs human movement and the impact of vascular structures on brain function. Through this course, learners will gain the foundational knowledge to understand how the anatomy of the human body, as well as introductory neuroanatomy, impact the care of patients/clients in the physical therapy profession.

This course exposes students to the initial steps in the patient/client professional relationship. It will focus on the following skills: patient history, observation, obtaining consent, performing a systems review, vital signs, palpation, range of motion, goniometry, muscle performance testing, safe patient handling, and functional mobility. This course requires the student to integrate knowledge from pre-requisite courses and concurrent Duke DPT courses to apply to patient care scenarios. We will emphasize integration of core values of the PT profession into practice. Our goal is that each student develops the necessary examination skills to assure both patient/client and student safety in the clinical environment. By the end of this course, the student will be able to perform a comprehensive, accurate and appropriately prioritized patient examination on a standardized patient in a practical examination format. Students will also complete a summative, comprehensive written final examination."

    "catalog_description": "Persistent pain affects 100 million Americans each year, and accounts for hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs. Despite its profound impact, persistent pain is poorly understood and poorly managed across medical disciplines. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the National Pain Strategy, which exposed a key reason for poor understanding and management of persistent pain: 'Most health care professions' education programs devote little time to education and training about pain and pain care.' In this course, learners gain a robust theoretical foundation to understand pain through the lens of biological, physiological, psychological, cognitive, social, and cultural factors. At the completion of the course, learners will have the skills to not only comprehensively assess pain and its influences, but to initiate evidence-based pain modulatory interventions which future Duke DPT courses will build upon. Importantly, course content is annually revised to align with current guidelines from the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and cutting-edge pain research."

The theoretical basis of pediatric development, typical and atypical development, movement, and function, along with compassion and high standards of care will be the foundation from which the assessment and management of various pediatric diagnoses will be discussed. The students will be introduced to the wide range of pediatric diagnoses, within the context of an individual child's life and their family, in order to optimize the child's ability to thrive across their lifespan. The etiology, pathology, pathophysiology, pathokinesiology, and clinical presentation of common pediatric disorders will be covered as well as the typical alterations in motor development that can accompany neurological, neuromuscular, genetic, and orthopedic disorders in children. Examination, evaluation, diagnosis, clinical reasoning, clinical decision- making, prognosis, and the use of standardized assessments, outcome measures and evidence-based interventions will be emphasized. Management across the lifespan across the ICF in various clinical settings will be addressed, including outpatient, school, early intervention, acute care, and home health settings. Students will participate in Pediatric Movement Matters Program in which they will learn from children with neurological and neuromuscular impairments and disabilities."

    "catalog_description": "The Terminal Clinical Experience (TCE) course series includes three, 12-week full-time supervised clinical experiences with emphasis on student management of patients across the lifespan and continuum of care. In addition, students engage in online learning resources throughout the TCE course series. During the clinical experiences, one or more selected and trained clinical instructors (CIs) will supervise students as they learn skills in all components of the physical therapy practice management model, including conducting patient examinations and evaluations, establishing patient diagnoses and prognoses, conducting patient interventions, and measuring patient outcomes. When possible, students will engage patients in practice patterns across the range of acute to chronic conditions. Students will participate in administrative aspects of ethical and efficacious practice. Performance expectations will include progression in level of independence in demonstrating competent, proficient, safe and effective examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention and professional practice skills."

    "catalog_description": "The US has been an attractive and desirable destination for many internationally educated physical therapists for decades, and although internationally trained physical therapists are often well trained and skilled, they frequently do not have the background or knowledge of the nuances and unique complexities that exist within the US health care systems, and the multiple roles that physical therapists can and do perform along the continuum of care. A better understanding of these complexities, and creating opportunities to discussion and debates, can improve the probability of success as the internationally educated clinician transition towards licensure within the US, and would also promote a welcoming environment for further growth for internationally educated physical therapists in our country. As such, we propose an on-line course that we have titled 'Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States: A Course for Internationally Educated Physical Therapists.' The main objective of this course is to provide foundational knowledge of the complexities and nuances of US-based physical therapy policy, practice and regulation that are critical to moving forward towards licensure and effective practice in the US.
