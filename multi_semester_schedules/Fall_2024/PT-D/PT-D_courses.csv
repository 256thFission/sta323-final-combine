10694,PT-D,632,01,Structure and Function of the Human Body,"Structure and Function of the Human Body provides the anatomic and basic science foundation necessary for physical therapists' understanding of the human body. The course emphasis is on the gross anatomy of the body. We will explore the relationships between the musculoskeletal, neurological, and vascular systems of the human body, including a critical examination of the morphology and function of the axial skeleton, upper and lower limbs, and cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, urogenital, reproductive, and neuronal systems. This course covers the biomechanics of various organ tissues, and the response of muscle, bone, joints, and soft tissue to disease and injury pertinent to the practice of physical therapy. This course will provide an introduction to the neuroanatomy of the central nervous system. Learners will command knowledge regarding how the nervous system governs human movement and the impact of vascular structures on brain function.

This course requires the student to integrate knowledge from pre-requisite courses and concurrent Duke DPT courses to apply to patient care scenarios. We will emphasize integration of core values of the PT profession into practice. Our goal is that each student develops the necessary examination skills to assure both patient/client and student safety in the clinical environment.

10709,PT-D,640,01,Pain Science,"Persistent pain affects 100 million Americans each year, and accounts for hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs. Despite its profound impact, persistent pain is poorly understood and poorly managed across medical disciplines. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the National Pain Strategy, which exposed a key reason for poor understanding and management of persistent pain: 'Most health care professions' education programs devote little time to education and training about pain and pain care.' In this course, learners gain a robust theoretical foundation to understand pain through the lens of biological, physiological, psychological, cognitive, social, and cultural factors. At the completion of the course, learners will have the skills to not only comprehensively assess pain and its influences, but to initiate evidence-based pain modulatory interventions which future Duke DPT courses will build upon. Importantly, course content is annually revised to align with current guidelines from the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and cutting-edge pain research.",,2,LEC,E,Physical Therapy - Doctorate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Physical Therapy-2nd year,08/18/2025,12/19/2025,Open,110,102,8,0,0,"Pass, Low Pass, Fail Grading",N,-; Departmental Staff

10698,PT-D,901,01,"Foreign Educated PT Course (FEPT-C): Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States","The US has been an attractive and desirable destination for many internationally educated physical therapists for decades, and although internationally trained physical therapists are often well trained and skilled, they frequently do not have the background or knowledge of the nuances and unique complexities that exist within the US health care systems, and the multiple roles that physical therapists can and do perform along the continuum of care. A better understanding of these complexities, and creating opportunities to discussion and debates, can improve the probability of success as the internationally educated clinician transition towards licensure within the US, and would also promote a welcoming environment for further growth for internationally educated physical therapists in our country. As such, we propose an on-line course that we have titled 'Healthcare Policy, Practice and Regulation in the United States: A Course for Internationally Educated Physical Therapists.' The main objective of this course is to provide foundational knowledge of the complexities and nuances of US-based physical therapy policy, practice and regulation that are critical to moving forward towards licensure and effective practice in the US.
