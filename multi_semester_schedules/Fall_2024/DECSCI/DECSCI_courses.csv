8539,DECSCI,189FS,01,Introduction to Machine Learning and Computational Models in the Social Sciences,"Our goal as social scientists is to build models of the world and provide advice to policy makers. Given that human actors are often strategic and the games they play are complex, building and testing these models is difficult and distinct from common examples of machine learning. A task that is often used to motivate introductions to machine learning is teaching a model to recognize hand-written characters using MNIST data (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist). Our task is harder: we must build models that involve forecasting human behavior ranging from votes in a legislature to changes in stock prices.",,1,SEM,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Open,18,14,4,0,18,Graded,Y,Scott De Marchi
8541,DECSCI,201,01,Discovering Game Theory: Social Complexity and Strategic Interdependence,"Strategy is all around you: In sports, the economy, law, politics, and your own social interactions. In this course, you will explore one of the foundational tools that social scientists use to analyze the complexity of strategic interactions: Game Theory. To do so, the course employs a highly interactive learning environment, in which you and your peers engage in strategic interactions that illustrate fundamental social dilemmas. In taking this course, you will gain a new analytical perspective into the complexity of social phenomena, and develop a solid foundation for additional course work in social science.",,1,LEC,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Open,60,59,1,0,60,Graded,Y,Georg Vanberg; Rodrigo Mahlmeister
5631,DECSCI,207,01,"National Security Simulation: The Arctic, Climate Change and Great Power Competition","Students will participate in a national security simulation in which they will have an assigned role as a state or non-state actor and work with teams to develop policy responses to a security crisis that changes and develops over time. The simulation this semester will involve security issues that arise due to the climate change in the Arctic that has opened up sea lanes and other resources that are generating competition for advantage among multiple nations. Participants will be required to grapple with a complex information environment that is polluted with misinformation, manipulation and deception. Instructional weeks on the substantive security issues the simulation addresses will be interspersed with gameplay. No prior experience in national security is required.",,1,LEC,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Closed,10,14,0,0,10,Graded,Y,David Schanzer
