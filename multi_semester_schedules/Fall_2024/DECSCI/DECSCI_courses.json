Given that human actors are often strategic and the games they play are complex, building and testing these models is difficult and distinct from common examples of machine learning. A task that is often used to motivate introductions to machine learning is teaching a model to recognize hand-written characters using MNIST data (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist). Our task is harder: we must build models that involve forecasting human behavior ranging from votes in a legislature to changes in stock prices."

In this course, you will explore one of the foundational tools that social scientists use to analyze the complexity of strategic interactions: Game Theory. To do so, the course employs a highly interactive learning environment, in which you and your peers engage in strategic interactions that illustrate fundamental social dilemmas. In taking this course, you will gain a new analytical perspective into the complexity of social phenomena, and develop a solid foundation for additional course work in social science."
