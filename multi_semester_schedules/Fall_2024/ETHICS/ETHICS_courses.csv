2995,ETHICS,102CNS,01,Finding Yourself and Creating Your Voice: Speech and Resilience for a Complicated World,"'Finding (and Creating) Your Voice' in the legal system involves being able to not only recognize all sides of an issue, but ultimately, to also articulate a position/argument that is persuasive. This voice might also be one that involves the ability to mediate and/or negotiate an outcome. These skills require an understanding of how the law deals with speech and how telling a compelling story is at the heart of 'practicing' within the legal system. In addition, one's effectiveness in finding and creating a voice is also directly connected to one's overall self-awareness, resilience, courage, curiosity, creativity, capacity to listen and leadership style, among other factors. In this course, students will have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of how the law handles speech, with a focus on the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution. This understanding will be undergirded by a consideration of (and ultimately a greater appreciation for) the difference between what can legally be said versus what 'should' be said in a particular situation. Students will be invited to practice how to civilly and compassionately disagree with someone, particularly a peer, while identifying and exploring their personal values, reconciling these values with how they find, create and use their voice at Duke and beyond.",,1,SEM,E,Undergraduate,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,12/05/2025,Closed,18,18,0,0,18,Graded,Y,Suzanne J Wasiolek

We will be using the doctor-patient relationship and the patient experience as a lens to understand the place of illness and empathy in human existence. We will explore concepts of culture and global health. How does culture affect all of us? How might members of marginalized groups in the US and citizens of low and middle income countries experience the processes of illness and healing.
