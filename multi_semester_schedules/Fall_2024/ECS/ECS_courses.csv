3777,ECS,792S,01,Microgrid Seminar,"This seminar will focus on designing and costing microgrids. Microgrids range from building to campus to community power systems that are connected to the conventional electric grid but can be islanded off from it, to systems that power remote facilities beyond and thus totally disconnected from the grid. Designing a microgrid entails more than simply hooking up distributed generation technologies to one or more loads. It also involves understanding existing regulations and the circumstances under which they can be connected, resolving ownership, etc. This seminar will explore how to analyze both load data and data on local renewable energy resource potential. Prerequisite: Environment 631, 711, and 716L.",,1.5,SEM,E,Nicholas School of Environment,In Person,Duke University,Durham,Regular Academic Session,08/25/2025,11/25/2025,Open,15,11,4,0,15,Graded,N,Lincoln F Pratson
