1237,SURGERY,205C,81,Surgery,"The required course in surgery is given in the second year and consists of a seven-week clinical clerkship. The primary goal is to provide a rich experience in the discipline of surgery while introducing students to the practice and principles of surgery. The objectives of this course are satisfied in a variety of ways. Students are actively incorporated into the surgical services. Students work with Duke Surgical residents and members of the surgical faculty in the traditional surgical disciplines and surgical specialties. Students are assigned patients on the surgical wards where they serve a crucial role in the care, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of their patients. Clinical rounds are made daily and provide real-time patient care experience and instruction. The fundamental topics which form the foundation of surgical practice are presented at bi-weekly seminars with presentations by senior staff of the Duke University Department of Surgery. The subjects discussed include a broad range of topics in general, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery. Students are also given an opportunity to reinforce their knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Students are also given an opportunity to test their hand eye coordination in the Surgical Education and Activities Lab.

1286,SURGERY,206C,16,Primary Care Leadership Track (PCLT) - Surgery,"The required course in surgery is given in the second year and consists of an eight week clinical clerkship. The primary goal is to provide a rich experience in the discipline of surgery while introducing students to the practice and principles of surgery. The objectives of this course are satisfied in a variety of ways. Students are actively incorporated into the surgical services. Students are divided into two groups, one at Duke University and the other at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, and each works with Duke Surgical residents and members of the surgical faculty in the traditional surgical disciplines and surgical specialties. Students are assigned patients on the surgical wards where they serve a crucial role in the care, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of their patients. Clinical rounds are made daily and provide real-time patient care experience and instruction. The fundamental topics which form the foundation of surgical practice are presented at bi-weekly seminars with presentations by senior staff of the Duke University Department of Surgery. The subjects discussed include a broad range of topics in general, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery in addition to the surgical specialties encompassing neurosurgery, orthopaedics, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, and urology/ Students are also given an opportunity to re-inforce their knowledge of anatomy and physiology. These fundamental principles are discussed during dissections of fresh tissue performed in the Duke University of Surgery Fresh Tissue Laboratory. Students are also given an opportunity to test their hand eye coordination in the Surgical Education and Activities Lab. The entire experience is consolidated during various sessions in experimental surgery, during which each student serves as the anesthesiologist, first assistant, and operating surgeon in performance of surgical procedures on experimental animals.

2381,SURGERY,401C,41,Advanced Surgical Clerkship,"The course aims to provide an intense educational experience with graded responsibility of surgical care. The student selects a specific surgeon mentor and is expected to attend multidisciplinary conferences, e.g. gastrointestinal, vascular, transplant, endocrine, oncology, etc. The student is expected to evaluate surgical patients in an outpatient setting as well as participating in inpatient and operative patient care. Attendance at clinical research conferences, case conferences, grand rounds, and sub-specialty conferences is required. Graduated patient care responsibility under supervision is encouraged to prepare the student for future assumption of duties as a house officer able to diagnose and treat surgical diseases. Students must verify with the specific attending that he/she is available during the time the student wishes to enroll in Surgery 401C. Only one student can work with a specific attending during any one-time period. Permission of instructor is required. For information about the course please contact Dr. Brian Gilmore at brian.gilmore@duke.edu. To obtain permission (and permission numbers) to enroll in the course, students should email both Ben Latta at thomas.latta@duke.edu and Brian Gilmore at brian.gilmore@duke.edu. Credit: 5.
