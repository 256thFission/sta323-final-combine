Students work with Duke Surgical residents and members of the surgical faculty in the traditional surgical disciplines and surgical specialties. Students are assigned patients on the surgical wards where they serve a crucial role in the care, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of their patients. Clinical rounds are made daily and provide real-time patient care experience and instruction. The fundamental topics which form the foundation of surgical practice are presented at bi-weekly seminars with presentations by senior staff of the Duke University Department of Surgery. The subjects discussed include a broad range of topics in general, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery.

The primary goal is to provide a rich experience in the discipline of surgery while introducing students to the practice and principles of surgery. The objectives of this course are satisfied in a variety of ways. Students are actively incorporated into the surgical services. Students are divided into two groups, one at Duke University and the other at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, and each works with Duke Surgical residents and members of the surgical faculty in the traditional surgical disciplines and surgical specialties. Students are assigned patients on the surgical wards where they serve a crucial role in the care, diagnosis, management, and follow-up of their patients. Clinical rounds are made daily and provide real-time patient care experience and instruction. The fundamental topics which form the foundation of surgical practice are presented at bi-weekly seminars with presentations by senior staff of the Duke University Department of Surgery. The subjects discussed include a broad range of topics in general, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery in addition to the surgical specialties encompassing neurosurgery, orthopaedics, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, and urology/ Students are also given an opportunity to re-inforce their knowledge of anatomy and physiology. These fundamental principles are discussed during dissections of fresh tissue performed in the Duke University of Surgery Fresh Tissue Laboratory. Students are also given an opportunity to test their hand eye coordination in the Surgical Education and Activities Lab. The entire experience is consolidated during various sessions in experimental surgery, during which each student serves as the anesthesiologist, first assistant, and operating surgeon in performance of surgical procedures on experimental animals.

    "catalog_description": "The course aims to provide an intense educational experience with graded responsibility of surgical care. The student selects a specific surgeon mentor and is expected to attend multidisciplinary conferences, e.g. gastrointestinal, vascular, transplant, endocrine, oncology, etc. The student is expected to evaluate surgical patients in an outpatient setting as well as participating in inpatient and operative patient care. Attendance at clinical research conferences, case conferences, grand rounds, and sub-specialty conferences is required. Graduated patient care responsibility under supervision is encouraged to prepare the student for future assumption of duties as a house officer able to diagnose and treat surgical diseases. Students must verify with the specific attending that he/she is available during the time the student wishes to enroll in Surgery 401C. Only one student can work with a specific attending during any one-time period. Permission of instructor is required. For information about the course please contact Dr. Brian Gilmore at brian.gilmore@duke.edu. To obtain permission (and permission numbers) to enroll in the course, students should email both Ben Latta at thomas.latta@duke.edu and Brian Gilmore at brian.gilmore@duke.edu. Credit: 5.

The student selects a specific surgeon mentor and is expected to attend multidisciplinary conferences, e.g. gastrointestinal, vascular, transplant, endocrine, oncology, etc. The student is expected to evaluate surgical patients in an outpatient setting as well as participating in inpatient and operative patient care. Attendance at clinical research conferences, case conferences, grand rounds, and sub-specialty conferences is required. Graduated patient care responsibility under supervision is encouraged to prepare the student for future assumption of duties as a house officer able to diagnose and treat surgical diseases. Students must verify with the specific attending that he/she is available during the time the student wishes to enroll in Surgery 401C. Only one student can work with a specific attending during any one-time period. Permission of instructor is required.

Under supervision, students function as sub-interns in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). Students are assigned their own patients and actively participate in daily rounds as part of the SICU team which includes intensivists, fellows, APPs, and residents. There are on-line didactic lectures which are expected to be completed during the month on core aspects of critical care, as well as weekly Critical Care Grand Rounds and ICU fellow conferences. Students rotate among the different teams with typically 3 weeks of daytime service coverage and a week of overnight coverage to maximize your education and experience. Shifts are 12 hours not including sign out of the service to the oncoming team. Students will work with SICU fellows and house staff in the supervised management of critically ill patients. Four weeks are spent in the SICU at Duke University Medical Center (trauma, vascular surgery, liver-kidney-pancreas transplantation, general surgery, surgical subspecialties, MICU and NICU overflow). There is emphasis on teaching of procedures and techniques necessary for the management of all critically ill patients including hemodynamic assessment and monitoring, cardiovascular resuscitation and use of vasoactive drugs, ventilator management including ARDS, prevention and management of nosocomial infections, and nutritional support. Students are formally evaluated by the SICU house staff and the attending physician. For more information, please contact Dr. Cory Vatsaas at 684-3636 or via email, cory.vatsaas@duke.edu. Further information and direction may be provided by the SICU fellow and attending of the week. The schedule is available in the SICU or by calling the SICU at 681-2241 to find out who is rounding that week. House staff sign out begins at 6:00 a.m. in the SICU. C-L: ANESTH-441C. Credit: 5.

    "catalog_description": "This course is designed to provide students interested in trauma care and emergency general surgery with further experience both in the Emergency Department and on the Inpatient Trauma Service. The course emphasizes both triage and resuscitation for major and minor emergency problems in the Emergency Department and also pre- and postoperative care on the Inpatient Trauma Service. There are opportunities to enhance the student's education by participating with the acute care surgery service, emergency general surgery consultation, and coverage of acute care general surgery operations. The student has a full-time experience by assuming duties and responsibilities similar to a sub-intern. Emphasis is placed on developing skills in the care of patients with multi-system injuries in the Emergency Department, Inpatient Service, and Operating Room. Students work in conjunction with the attending staff, residents on the Trauma Service, and our advanced practice providers. Students will typically spend three weeks covering daytime trauma service obligations and one week of night coverage to maximize your education and experience. For more information, please contact Dr. Cory Vatsaas at 684-3636 or via email at cory.vatsaas@duke.edu. Additional information can be obtained by the Trauma Chief, who is the senior resident on the service, pager 970-9995. Students should meet in the General Surgery Resident bunker/lounge on the 3rd floor DMP across from the DMP OR entrance at 6:00 a.m. on the first day of the rotation. Credit: 4. Enrollment: max 3.
