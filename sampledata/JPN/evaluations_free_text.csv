The professor was wonderful (always there after class to answer questions, very kindly facilitating discussions, providing feedback), and our daily homework assignments were corrected within a day. It was the perfect structure for a class, and it was an entirely forgiving one for language learning as well."

Cultural encounters really made the class more stimulating."

It didn't necessarily cause me to consider/think in new ways other than the new skills that come with learning a language.

It made me feel like I could go to Japan and hold basic conversations and survive at restaurants, which was incredibly rewarding."

No matter how you love Japanese culture and people, she will ruin it!Here is the complete story:Saito is the most mean, annoying, and old-school person I have ever met at Duke. She is bad at teaching but good at making troubles. I believe you might have heard that this is a challenging class. I have taken some of the most challenging STEM classes at Duke. But I feel I learned a lot from suffering in these classes.HOWEVER, the suffering she makes you feel is meaningless. Completely meaningless. Throughout the semester, she will find you a lot of troubles and she is zero-tolerant to any mistakes you made. She never attempts to empathize with your life and what you experience. She is only a MACHINE, a cold machine, to enforce rules.Ok, you might not be a picky person about who teach the class. But in her class, you will not succeed by grinding before exams. The exams only contribute a small percent to your grade. Basically, this class will DOMINATE your life. You have to be constantly hardworking to succeed. Imagine, college can be stressful, well, most of the time. You don’t want to add another layer of misery to your life, trust me."
