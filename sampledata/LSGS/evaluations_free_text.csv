Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

The first few weeks the classroom was set up in a U-shape but they saw that within the large group students were not engaging as much so they split us up into groups of 3 or 4. This took away some of the pressure and helped start more stimulating conversations within our small groups but also within the larger class setting.

Please describe three specific things you learned.",The insights on the terms of Latinx and the way I look at things when it comes to latinos has changed in a way where I was aware but never understood the larger implications and impact the term or labels could have. It was a super interesting topic as well as how we discussed banned books too.

I loved the various media that was incorporated into the class such as movies, podcasts, and different videos."

Please describe three specific things you learned.",I learned a lot about Latino literature and how it's viewed in the US. It was interesting to talk about what gets published/publicized and why. I think I also just learned a lot from the texts we read. It's cool how much more you can understand a person/author's experience or culture just through exposing yourself to more literature.

This allowed students to learn more formal elements on Tuesday which equipped us for discussions Thursdays. The professor was very open to new ideas and the classroom felt like a safe space to share and exchange ideas.
