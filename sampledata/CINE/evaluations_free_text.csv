Turning our attention to familiar European storytelling traditions, we also studied the morphology of fairytales, as explicated by Vladimir Propp, and the socio-psychological imperatives baked into the archetypes of ""fairy stories,"" as posited by Tolkien.

I'm amazed by how Professor Jenny Lion was able to take seemingly widespread concepts and dig deeply into what they meant to our society, so much so that we were able to produce creative video art through examining the contexts of everything we discussed within the course. In Video Art and Politics, I developed a deeper understanding of how moving images can function as both aesthetic expression and political intervention. The course expanded my critical lens as a media maker and viewer. Three specific things I learned are:- The Power of Visual Rhetoric – I gained insight into how visual language, framing, and editing choices can shape political meaning and influence audiences emotionally and intellectually. This helped me reflect more intentionally on my own creative decisions and the messages they convey.- Expanded Definitions of Activism and Art – I learned how artists and filmmakers use nontraditional forms, such as video installations, essay films, and acts of tactical media, as political tools. These works challenged me to rethink the boundaries of what counts as political art and to appreciate the role of experimentation in social critique.- Process as Political Practice – Through the final project and class discussions, I understood how the process of making video art (including collaboration, research, and engagement with communities) can itself be a political act. This insight will continue to shape how I approach media production and storytelling in socially engaged contexts."

Also, Jenny co-ordinated artists to come speak to our class like Wendy Clarke who did The Love Tapes. I found her visit so inspiring that I decided to recreate her work for myself and Jenny kindly connected me with Wendy and formed that connection and gave me lots of advice on how to carry it out respectfully and properly.

One of the most impactful components was the balance between theory and practice—readings and screenings provided historical and conceptual context, while creative assignments allowed us to respond artistically. This dual approach helped me internalize complex ideas through hands-on application. I also appreciated the peer feedback sessions and in-class critiques, which created a collaborative and supportive environment.

Instead, grace is given for all students to learn the medium and experiment with their own creative impulses."

He is a good teacher and can easily explain concepts and techniques to a beginner filmmaker. I think Steve should keep the final project assignment and the short film screenings related to the assignment. The final project pushes students to apply the skills they have learnt in real life, the screenings are a source of good inspiration for students. I also think other short assignments are great in the way they focus on one particular skill of filmmaking. This allows students to really master a skill."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was a great introduction into understanding film on a more technical level! We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

Overall though, if you have any interest in theater or management the class is very interesting. If you have no background in theater the class does cover most of what you would need to know. The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

Making myself dive into writing for a new medium (as I had no previous experience with screenwriting) is what really started to give me a sense for what goes into a script.
Stay on top of your long script at the end, though. Checkpoints are built into the class, so don't get behind on them, because that 80 page script is very manageable if broken up over multiple weeks, but very scary if you've let it pile up!"

At the same time though, be flexible once you actually start shooting, as sometimes you can't get the exact shots you want for reasons outside of your control, like space or lighting constraints."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned so many things that it's hard to list all of them, especially because Professor Hareth has a way of teaching students both soft and hard skills that are helpful not only in film but in other parts of what it takes to be a successful student. For example, planning a film may seem like easy work, but it actually takes a lot of effort and practice, and you have to learn to be able to take feedback and criticism from your peers. Or, you may start filming something with a vision in mind and then realize things aren't working the way you imagined and think on the spot for ways to correct them. We also learned how to use Premiere Pro, which is much more challenging than I could have known, but without the class I wouldn't have taken the time to learn the skill, which I'm sure will be useful for my future. Lastly, we learned how to use a camera and a tripod, how to frame videos and fix lighting, how to focus on your subjects, and using various audio techniques."

It allows the class to remain true to how screenplays are read and understood in the film industry but it also really allowed me to get an understanding of what was effective and what wasn't in a way that I didn't really get from just reading the work on the page. I also really liked that we got to stick with one idea for the majority of the semester. I don't often get to do that in other classes and it really allowed me to dive deep into a plot line and into the characters I was writing. I'm really proud of the final product.

2- I learned to find inspiration in other peoples' works. Throughout the course, I watched the works of my classmates, which have been amazing, and as I learned more about their experiences, I learned to reinterpret my own and express them through film.
3- Collaboration is necessary. Dance film is the kind of hybrid work that requires working across different fields, therefore bridging them and that connection can only be me through other people."

I'm amazed by how Professor Jenny Lion was able to take seemingly widespread concepts and dig deeply into what they meant to our society, so much so that we were able to produce creative video art through examining the contexts of everything we discussed within the course. In Video Art and Politics, I developed a deeper understanding of how moving images can function as both aesthetic expression and political intervention. The course expanded my critical lens as a media maker and viewer. Three specific things I learned are:- The Power of Visual Rhetoric – I gained insight into how visual language, framing, and editing choices can shape political meaning and influence audiences emotionally and intellectually. This helped me reflect more intentionally on my own creative decisions and the messages they convey.- Expanded Definitions of Activism and Art – I learned how artists and filmmakers use nontraditional forms, such as video installations, essay films, and acts of tactical media, as political tools. These works challenged me to rethink the boundaries of what counts as political art and to appreciate the role of experimentation in social critique.- Process as Political Practice – Through the final project and class discussions, I understood how the process of making video art (including collaboration, research, and engagement with communities) can itself be a political act. This insight will continue to shape how I approach media production and storytelling in socially engaged contexts."

I feel like the the first artists using video in the 70s that she showed us were very intriguing and I really enjoyed being exposed to them. Also, Jenny co-ordinated artists to come speak to our class like Wendy Clarke who did The Love Tapes.

One of the most impactful components was the balance between theory and practice—readings and screenings provided historical and conceptual context, while creative assignments allowed us to respond artistically. This dual approach helped me internalize complex ideas through hands-on application. I also appreciated the peer feedback sessions and in-class critiques, which created a collaborative and supportive environment.

Working in the darkroom was a very informative hands-on experience, as was using the Steenbeck manual editing table to splice and cut together films physically. In addition to the Steenbeck editing techniques, we were taught how to use Adobe Lightroom to edit our films digitally.

And throughout both mediums, we were continuously empowered as students to ask questions and contribute to the discussion. Specifically, I think the class speakers are what helped to facilitate student learning. Not only did we hear from journalists and journalist experts, but we also heard from students like us who have ventured into journalism and encountered its problems from a fresh perspective. We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning. The individual prompts were also well-timed with what we were currently learning about or where we were in the course syllabus/timeline."

It was really fun and very manageable. If you want to learn more about editing and found footage, it is definitely a great class to take.

It is special because it focuses on a genre that is not widely known in both community and teaches students how to combine the best of both worlds.

This course has showed me that there is so much more to movement and capturing movement than people usually think.
2- I learned to find inspiration in other peoples' works. Throughout the course, I watched the works of my classmates, which have been amazing, and as I learned more about their experiences, I learned to reinterpret my own and express them through film.
3- Collaboration is necessary. Dance film is the kind of hybrid work that requires working across different fields, therefore bridging them and that connection can only be me through other people."

I don't think this is the fault of the professor but more the class makeup -- it was dominated by students with the same ideologies getting their news from large papers that skewed left of center. Maybe in order to combat this, more of the readings could be from conservative outlets or perhaps ""extra credit"" of not only keeping up with Reliable Sources/The Morning but also regularly consuming news from right-leaning papers.

In some of my other classes which have had guest speakers, the professor often will just have them come in and lecture at us for an hour. It often leads to a boring and unengaging class. That never happened here. Whenever we had a guest, Professor Tash did a fantastic job at engaging the speaker through a set of questions. It was more of an interview than anything else. It made the class more engaging and when we were able to better see how interesting our guests were, it was hard to look away."

I felt that sometimes the actual classes felt dry since there was not an expectation to participate in class discussions. Often times the class stayed silent or surface-level when asked questions related to the readings or films. I feel that either making the class entirely lecture-based or cultivating an environment that inspires participation would enhance intellectual simulation.

Not only did we hear from journalists and journalist experts, but we also heard from students like us who have ventured into journalism and encountered its problems from a fresh perspective. We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning.

The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

Professor Bell was great, and I had so much fun with this class. There's a lot of writing, but I think that's a good part of the class. Making myself dive into writing for a new medium (as I had no previous experience with screenwriting) is what really started to give me a sense for what goes into a script.
Stay on top of your long script at the end, though. Checkpoints are built into the class, so don't get behind on them, because that 80 page script is very manageable if broken up over multiple weeks, but very scary if you've let it pile up!"
