Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I believe the methodology of doing the projects in modules, in which you work on it through 3-4 weeks, is great; it allows us to have time to be more familiar and comfortable with new software/digital tools and to improve the ideas over time. This method was certainly efficient for me, and although the course was fast-paced, I could keep up with the assignments throughout the weeks."

It was sometimes challenging, especially when I wanted to develop more complex ideas. However, the scope of the submissions was clear and manageable, which kept projects from becoming overly time-consuming or needing finalization. I also appreciated Professor Olson's efforts, such as the detailed and clear written and video instructions he sent every week, which made the assignments and learning process much easier."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The Creative Cartography course created a highly engaging and supportive learning environment that encouraged both critical thinking and creative exploration. Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

The integration of critical theory with hands-on design work created a unique space to experiment and question—something I haven’t experienced in other courses. The encouragement to situate our own identities and research within our mapping projects made the work personally meaningful and conceptually rich.What made the course especially engaging was the freedom to pursue a self-directed final project. It pushed me to synthesize spatial analysis, historical research, and visual storytelling in new ways. I was able to explore how cartography can represent liminal spaces and historical erasure—central themes in my dissertation."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. The specifics of design thinking to execute a concept (e.g. mapping out exactly what a user is doing and what kind of output or feedback they should be getting in return)
2. Learning to see the logic of design as a whole system (like how an input gives an output, and how that links back to the overall functionality). We did a lot of sketching and diagramming to outline these relationships
3. Imagining more experimental/unique interfaces & thinking of unusual/new ways people can interact with a computer, such as touch, sound, motion, even things like environmental changes."

The presentation-based format also made it easy to learn from each other and see a wide range. I liked the flexible structure & think it encouraged creativity. We also kept our own ""Book of Notice"" throughout the semester & it was up to us what we put/how often we updated; this was also a nice way to be creative & see/be inspired by our moodboards."

To make the class even more intellectually stimulating, it could be helpful to look at a broader range of real-world experimental interfaces together as a class. While we were encouraged to explore, some of the presentations—both mine and others—started to feel a bit repetitive and leaned heavily toward apps and consumer products. It would’ve been exciting to get more exposure to how different interface concepts are being applied in fields like art, tech, and research. Professor Seaman was also knowledgeable & knew a lot of different interfaces/works/research relevant to our presentation/project topics off the top of his head; it might have been more engaging to learn directly from some examples/insights alongside student presentations."

I would propose that students work towards making an actual website at the end of the project instead of making a slideshow presentation as we did not implement any skills of interface design. This class is more accurately described as a discussion class since there was a lack of knowledge being applied. Each week’s class was the same with presentations taking the entire period, so I would get rid of these a commit to having an open discussion about specific principles and techniques each class to add direction."

To make the class even more intellectually stimulating, it could be helpful to look at a broader range of real-world experimental interfaces together as a class. While we were encouraged to explore, some of the presentations—both mine and others—started to feel a bit repetitive and leaned heavily toward apps and consumer products. It would’ve been exciting to get more exposure to how different interface concepts are being applied in fields like art, tech, and research. Professor Seaman was also knowledgeable & knew a lot of different interfaces/works/research relevant to our presentation/project topics off the top of his head; it might have been more engaging to learn directly from some examples/insights alongside student presentations."

I would propose that students work towards making an actual website at the end of the project instead of making a slideshow presentation as we did not implement any skills of interface design. This class is more accurately described as a discussion class since there was a lack of knowledge being applied. Each week’s class was the same with presentations taking the entire period, so I would get rid of these a commit to having an open discussion about specific principles and techniques each class to add direction."

The structure of the course especially the mix of readings, creative projects, and reflective assignments allowed for a deep and personal engagement with the theme of failure. For future years, I would definitely keep the reflective writing assignments and the open, discussion-based format that helped ideas evolve organically."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The Creative Cartography course created a highly engaging and supportive learning environment that encouraged both critical thinking and creative exploration. Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

I also appreciate that I was encouraged to think creatively and given plenty of freedom to design my project."

The integration of critical theory with hands-on design work created a unique space to experiment and question—something I haven’t experienced in other courses. The encouragement to situate our own identities and research within our mapping projects made the work personally meaningful and conceptually rich.What made the course especially engaging was the freedom to pursue a self-directed final project. It pushed me to synthesize spatial analysis, historical research, and visual storytelling in new ways. I was able to explore how cartography can represent liminal spaces and historical erasure—central themes in my dissertation."
