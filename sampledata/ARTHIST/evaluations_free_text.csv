For anyone remotely interested in the built environment, this is a ""must-take"" course at Duke. Even if you have zero interest in architecture, I would still take this course.  Some of the most intellectual fun and curiosity I've ever experienced came in this classroom. The sketchbook component is fun and diversifies assignments in a nice way. Not super labor intensive course and the content is truly fascinating. Mid-term and final are worth a lot but they are totally manageable if you pay attention in lecture. Textbook, despite what the syllabus says, is completely optional (I didn't read it after the second week of class); but, it's a nice resource if you miss a lecture or are looking for a way to study for the midterm/final."

3) Not being afraid of new places. This is my first time traveling abroad. I have never left the US before, much less felt a new culture. I was very afraid at first, but this course has taught me that I am able to be independent in a new cultural setting. My instructors were amazing guides as well, and support was there when needed.

I learned how to recognize mythological themes in archeological sights. I also learned how to compare various burial methods, banqueting styles, and gender roles as they changed throughout Roman history. I know to challenge textual accounts of events, for they might be exaggerated or biased.  
Further, this course helped me adapt to living in a new city! I learned how to compile the little Italian I know to make my way around the neighborhoods.

We learned through repetition and the explanation of our instructors. Later on in our course, we were able to answer their questions swiftly based on the knowledge we had gathered.

Further, mixing in different layers of history made the course stimulating. This particularly applied to Rome. I liked how some days consisted of ancient sights as well as churches or Renaissance exhibits. I feel like the course moved around the right amount; sufficient time was spent in Campania, Pompeii, and Rome, yet we were not in one location for too long.

Inspecting the theses, curatorial processes, and public reactions to each exhibition we looked at really helped me understand the practice of curation throughout the 20th and 21st century, and see how it's evolved to become it's own discipline in the art world. The factors that go into creating exhibitions, including the history of the collections and the agency of the buildings themselves, have a much larger significance than I'd previously realized, and this course did an excellent job of analyzing each of these aspects when studying art history."

Having an assigned person who was designated to facilitate conversation and ask questions for each and every exhibition we looked at was not only engaging, but also made the discussions much deeper and fleshed out than if there were no facilitator (based on experience from other classes, there would be a lot more awkward silence). I think the structure of having a discussion after each presentation was super effective, and it paced the class nicely so none of the presentations were overwhelming or long, and the teachings from the presentations were fresh on peoples' minds during the discussions. the guest speakers and trip through the Nasher's galleries were also invigorating and a nice addition to the learning experience. I think the requiring note taking to be analog, and requesting that laptops and devices stay stowed throughout the class was also conducive to a better learning environment, as it kept people present and focused on the lesson at hand, rather than back tracking through the readings or getting distracted by everything else a laptop has to offer."

If you are interested in art history, architecture, or life during the Renaissance, it is certainly a class you should take. It gives you perspective for when you see old buildings in modern times --- where the architectural elements came from, and why they were initially implemented in the designs.

I also learned how to conduct a formal analysis of an artwork as well as bring two unrelated works into a conversation with one another through backing with a formal/theoretical framework. This increased by knowledge basis and completely changed how I look at artworks today in museums, including a recent visit to The Whitney that I had just a couple weeks ago.Lastly, I learned how to be an active thinker about art history and compare it to other subjects. I am not as familiar with art history as I am a social sciences (Economics/Finance) major, so learning how to interpret and understand artworks/groups in context of global history aided in my ability to understand how they relate to the development of art history and art movements overall. Even though the course was a high level of knowledge/academic, I was able to be an active participant and engage with the material.Thank you Thea for an amazing course experience and opportunity to expand my knowledge basis of my Art History minor.

Each week had a respective 'theme' (for a lack of better words), whether it be the street, the nation, the bureaucracy, etc. that I felt created a strong foundation for understanding why the readings and selective artists were chosen for each lecture. She also did a great job facilitating discussion. As someone who is not an art history student, I felt really comfortable sharing my ideas in this course, and Professor Ballard would always be able to extract even more substance from my thoughts than I could do alone."

Instead of categorizing by time frame or region, it was by themes such as ""the corporation"" or ""the bureaucracy"" which I think is very appropriate due to the nature of contemporary art and its non-linearity.

This helped me so much relate certain artworks to both the container as well as my previous knowledge of artwork demographics. The cleanly structured use of these periodization allowed me to benefit and learn the most while avoiding confusion. This helped with the Canvas LMS and allowed me to concentrate on concrete topics on step at a time without getting confused.I also enjoyed the use of office hours in advance to both papers so that I can full understand the topic, paper type, and discuss with Thea my potential ideas on what to write about. The autonomy with paper selection/conversation made me excited about the course and excited to write the papers to share the knowledge that I learned. Keeping these office hour discussions into future years should definitely be on top!"

Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

The integration of critical theory with hands-on design work created a unique space to experiment and question—something I haven’t experienced in other courses. The encouragement to situate our own identities and research within our mapping projects made the work personally meaningful and conceptually rich.What made the course especially engaging was the freedom to pursue a self-directed final project. It pushed me to synthesize spatial analysis, historical research, and visual storytelling in new ways.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Dr. Griebeler is an awkward professor, but the combination of his social awkwardness and enthusiasm/extensive knowledge about the subject makes the class enjoyable and chill. He starts with discussions of the readings and then facilitates seminars (led by small groups) that discuss the readings. Doing it that way changed class dynamics and freshened things up, providing breaks to students in terms of workload. His required papers are pretty short but you learn quite a bit from them: his grading is helpful but not harsh. He wants you to learn and it shows (e.g., giving us a crash course on French, drawing plants, and show-and-tell presentations about modern depictions of Medusa). I also loved the trips to the museum and herbarium! He does not make his class monotonous and his teaching adapts to his class and what his class needs to learn. He also brought snacks to class (2 hours long), which helped students who skipped breakfast. Super kind guy, will take another class with him if I can."

This allowed students to gain experience synthesizing information and presenting it to a big group, but there were also some readings or concepts that I feel should have been introduced by the professor, instead (i.e. the major topics or themes that would underscore the entire semester). Class discussions were always engaging and the professor would always jump in if there was something that she needed to say, correct, or introduce, but overall the structure relied a lot on trusting other students to understand the material and relay it to each other."

They were more dynamic and allowed us to incorporate a lot of skills we personally had. It gave us an organization or community to reach out to, which helped. I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy."" I think the final paper was kind of shoved in there at the end, but I much prefer that over any final exam."

The class was a great mix between lecturing about various artists and topics and discussion about readings and class topics. The class was also regularly spaced with field trips and excursions to get up close and personal with all of the things which were being covered. The assignments were also spaced in a way that made them feel approachable. Additionally, the Instructors created an incredibly welcoming and safe environment from the very start."
