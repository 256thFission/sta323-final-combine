Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned more of how to figure out answers to technical questions on my own. I'm not at all saying that the lecture wasn't good, it was excellent, but I mean that I like the somewhat lack of direction that grad class problem sets give because it allows me the opportunity to figure out the best way and place to find the answer to the various problems. I learned a great deal about quantum computing, and I have an excellent jumping off point for delving much deeper into this area, something which I had little to none of before the course. I also learned a great deal about quantum computing as a whole."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","For one, the main instructor and TA were both amazing! They were very knowledgeable, and treated us all with the utmost respect. Anytime I had a question in the course, I was always given a direction to go by one of the instructors, and I never felt like it was a silly question or I was wasting their time, as is sometimes the case with instructors. For the size of the class and material covered, I felt like the structure of the course, with 50% interaction, 50% lecture worked excellently. I also 100% love and agree with the style of homework submissions which is no specific due date, and unlimited resubmissions. This style of submission, in my opinion, is the only proper way to do it, as the goal of problem sets should exclusively be to develop understanding of the material. Just to emphasize, I absolutely loved almost every aspect of this course. My background in quantum computing prior to the course was little to none, and I feel like this course did an excellent job at giving me a good base, as well as igniting my excitement for the field overall."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","More teamwork. I think at the beginning of the course, there was an openness to group work, but by mid-end, there was an added emphasis on group work. Attendance policy was great, and the people who came to class wanted to be there. I absolutely approve of this course structure."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The small class made it feel more like a seminar than a large lecture. Questions were often asked by everyone and the professor and TA took the time to make sure that everybody understood the material before moving on. I think this is advantageous since no one is rushing to simply complete problem sets that they don't have a solid understanding of. On a relevant note, I particularly liked that there was no hard due dates for the problem sets. The sets were very long and provided a good introduction to the material where we could think creatively, and we were encouraged to ask detailed questions rather than just completing them. Taking away this pressure really helped me organize my thoughts, take meticulous notes, and set great fundamentals for me to explore quantum computing on my own."

It's hard to stay engaged if the lecturer is noticeably unprepared, which never occurred in this course. The material was also taught in an overall passionate way and in a way that I could follow and made sense. The only things I would change are to, first of all, slow the pace of lecture just a bit, and two, if able, do a bit more application examples. For reference, I am coming from an EE background, and I felt like the pace of the lecture was just a bit too fast for me. Also, it could be difficult sometimes to imagine what these quantum computers look like physically (how to make, interact, and measure qubits) and how they can be practically used in research, i.e. why they are important."

Putting me in this place really helps you understand which methods work and which don't, and they go through very similar concepts in class as well. The textbooks are extremely helpful in giving us a good starting point, but I think the professor/TAs could have pointed us more towards which chapters to look at in the problem set. This would have made it a lot easier to get started on some of the problems."

However, in the last month the course got very abstract and much harder, and the abstraction made me feel like the course was veering into territory that was less relevant to my research interests. This made me stop submitting homework and then attend lecture far less often, and I then put much more effort into my other classes+interests.I don't know if there would've been a way to prevent me from dropping off in the last month; I don't think it makes sense to water down the content. I just wonder if maybe I wasn't the target audience for this class, and I realized it too late."

However, my background is number theoretic, and while a lot of the theory here is absolutely important for my field, there are a lot of topics that I wished we had touched, even if it was just crumbs (Galois representations, representations over Q and fields of positive characteristic, group cohomology, Lie algebra cohomology, algebraic groups, etc). I know a lot of these are unreasonable for a first course, but I think I would be more than satisfiied if some acknowledgement to these was given. Or perhaps instead of a final exam, a final project or a final presentation would be more stimulating. I know I would feel a lot more excitement if I was writing something about these topics rather than worrying about the exam."

The material was often presented to us in a convoluted way, and many people left Dr. Wu's lectures feeling more lost than when they came in. Having the chance to work through problems with teammates facilitated an effective learning environment and helped guide people who were lost with the material.This class could be made more stimulating by easing the workload of weekly problem sets, pre-class assignments, and quizzes. Many people in this class have other time-consuming STEM courses that also have weekly homework, and most of the time people in this class felt they could not keep up with the material and assignments. Additionally, the assignments we received were always graded harshly and based on correctness when many people did not know how to do problems because Dr. Wu's lectures were ineffective and confusing. Easing the outside-of-class workload on students and focusing more on team-based, in-person learning would help alleviate stress on students and promote healthy engagement with the material."

Dr. Wu's lectures are often rushed with little in-class help on how to solve problems, which is how you will be graded. While recitation sections are helpful because they allow collaboration and learning from your peers, the material is often handed to you and you are expected to struggle with it. Unfortunately, this version of physics did not achieve what it set out to do, which is to make physics more comprehensible for life sciences students and non-math majors. If you appreciate challenging concepts and independent-learning outside of class, then this one is perfect for you.

Having the chance to work through problems with teammates facilitated an effective learning environment and helped guide people who were lost with the material.This class could be made more stimulating by easing the workload of weekly problem sets, pre-class assignments, and quizzes. Many people in this class have other time-consuming STEM courses that also have weekly homework, and most of the time people in this class felt they could not keep up with the material and assignments. Additionally, the assignments we received were always graded harshly and based on correctness when many people did not know how to do problems because Dr. Wu's lectures were ineffective and confusing. Easing the outside-of-class workload on students and focusing more on team-based, in-person learning would help alleviate stress on students and promote healthy engagement with the material."

Dr. Wu's lectures are often rushed with little in-class help on how to solve problems, which is how you will be graded.

Unfortunately, this version of physics did not achieve what it set out to do, which is to make physics more comprehensible for life sciences students and non-math majors.

I also learned how to approach challenging problems, as many of the problems we tackled on the homework in discussion pushed me to combine my multiple topics we learned throughout the course (i.e. rotational motion with conservation of energy). Finally, I also learned how to trust in myself and apply my learning, because we would often have quizzes testing our conceptual knowledge at the end of each class."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I'm not sure about during the semester, but for the summer, I don't think the team-based learning worked well. By the second half of the course, the lectures took up most of our time block, so we did not have enough time to do in class problem sets with our team. Also, even if we had time like the last 30 mins of class to do ICP, everyone would do their homework or something else instead because the HW would be due that day and the pacing of the class was super fast. I think this greatly hindered the objectives and effectiveness of team based learning. Therefore, either switching to non-team based learning or coming up with a different schedule/pacing of the course would be necessary. I did like how, by the second half of the course though, that the professor really took the time to explain concepts in lecture by writing them down one by one on paper with us instead of just flipping through the slides that were very confusing to understand by itself. This did take up a lot of time, though, but I think it was helpful to understand the new concepts."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","to be honest, the structure of this course is what hindered my learning the most. I hope the professor realize that 6 hours of class every day is not the best way to teach physics, especially for students who aren't already comfortable with physics. I saw many students, including myself drained out after each class, because we had to digest contents after contents for six hours. 
Also the graders for this class took off way too many points for the most useless stuff."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","This has been such a difficult experience. In no world should a summer class be 9am-5pm four days a week. The department states that this style of teaching was designed to accomodate to students and allow RGB to answer questions. In reality, lectures took up 4-4.5 hours every day, leaving limited time for in-class problem sets. The lectures were very long and went into much more detail than what was needed for the exams/quizzes. RGB did spend a lot of time ""reviewing"" math concepts, however, a lot of the content was tangents filled with unnecessary proofs which we did not need to know. This course is very intense, I sped an average of 14 hours on physics every day, which is not sustainable. I had to quit my job due to the courseload and commitment I have to this course. The homeworks were long and much harder than the quiz problems and exams. The TAs were very helpful. RGB is willing to answer questions after class. I spent little time learning the material and a majority of my time cramming in all of the work by the due date. I would never advise anyone to take this course in the summer, I am sure this class is much more manageable during the semester."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I'm not sure about during the semester, but for the summer, I don't think the team-based learning worked well. By the second half of the course, the lectures took up most of our time block, so we did not have enough time to do in class problem sets with our team. Also, even if we had time like the last 30 mins of class to do ICP, everyone would do their homework or something else instead because the HW would be due that day and the pacing of the class was super fast. I think this greatly hindered the objectives and effectiveness of team based learning. Therefore, either switching to non-team based learning or coming up with a different schedule/pacing of the course would be necessary. I did like how, by the second half of the course though, that the professor really took the time to explain concepts in lecture by writing them down one by one on paper with us instead of just flipping through the slides that were very confusing to understand by itself. This did take up a lot of time, though, but I think it was helpful to understand the new concepts."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","to be honest, the structure of this course is what hindered my learning the most. I hope the professor realize that 6 hours of class every day is not the best way to teach physics, especially for students who aren't already comfortable with physics. I saw many students, including myself drained out after each class, because we had to digest contents after contents for six hours. 
Also the graders for this class took off way too many points for the most useless stuff."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","This has been such a difficult experience. In no world should a summer class be 9am-5pm four days a week. The department states that this style of teaching was designed to accomodate to students and allow RGB to answer questions. In reality, lectures took up 4-4.5 hours every day, leaving limited time for in-class problem sets. The lectures were very long and went into much more detail than what was needed for the exams/quizzes. RGB did spend a lot of time ""reviewing"" math concepts, however, a lot of the content was tangents filled with unnecessary proofs which we did not need to know. This course is very intense, I sped an average of 14 hours on physics every day, which is not sustainable. I had to quit my job due to the courseload and commitment I have to this course. The homeworks were long and much harder than the quiz problems and exams. The TAs were very helpful. RGB is willing to answer questions after class. I spent little time learning the material and a majority of my time cramming in all of the work by the due date. I would never advise anyone to take this course in the summer, I am sure this class is much more manageable during the semester."

Understandably, this was my first summer class, but the hours of lectures every day on topics that were far too difficult and dense to understand were a horrible 6 weeks of experience. We barely had any time to fully grasp concepts before we were moving onto the next one seconds later. The lectures were hard to follow and monotonous. I also think that because we derived every single formula, I ended up having these notes that were 90% unnecessary and harder to look back at.

However, some of the problems seemed more like a test on whether or not we were able to figure out what combination and order of techniques to use rather than the techniques themselves, which made certain homework problems very confusing as there's not necessarily a reference for problems with many steps and equations."

Problems always serve as a mental workout and force you to whip out math skills you forgot about or that got a little rusty. There are times though where this has actually been fun, and once you get into the groove of a problem (and actually know what's going on for some of them) it is pleasantly stimulating. But of course lots of times it is also unpleasantly stimulating. Such a dichotomy."

It is also extremely disorganized and hard so expect to feel discouraged. Dr. Brown tries to help but sometimes he forgets that a lot of us don't have physics background so things he finds are common sense aren't.

The TAs even were struggling with the amount of work they had to grade. I'd say, be prepared to be very overwhelmed and very stressed. They also say you don't need a math background, but you do need a math background and a physics background. I had never taken physics before in my life, and I struggled so much, while to others this was a breeze.  There were way too many different levels of people with different backgrounds walking in, and there was no consideration to that at all. The expectations were the same from everyone.

However, physics just isn't a class that necessarily stimulates me intellectually."

It wasn't until I went to helproom to work on homework problems (because they are often nearly impossible to complete without help from a TA/instructor) that I learned what I needed to know from the lectures."

It would have also been more engaging if we solved more problems before the weekly quizzes. I at times felt unprepared for the content based off of the lectures alone.

It could be cool if there were some slightly more applied examples brought in to the assignments or shared with the class. While it is of course good to build your foundations with simpler problems, it could be engaging to include more ties to specific situations students may be interested in applying physics to."

PHYSICS-121L-001_Wu__Ying_Fall_2024.html,Fall 2024,PHYSICS-121L-001 : GENERAL PHYSICS I-A.PHYSICS-121L-001.,Ying Wu,4,What made this class stimulating or how could it be more intellectually stimulating if it wasn’t?,"This class was not intellectually stimulating, as the procedural roadblocks we experienced prevented much learning and engagement with the curriculum. Students were assigned a sizable amount of homework each week with little guidance on how to do problems outside of help rooms, which many of us could not attend because we have other classes. As a result, many people felt like they only had time to finish assignments and not truly understand the work required of them. This meant we did not engage much with the material and were at a disadvantage on assessments where we were required to work under time constraints.Additionally, the course's focus on textbook learning instead of practicing hands-on examples made many people seem like we had to teach ourselves and had no guidance from the professor. As a result, many of us acquired a ""learned helplessness"" such that we felt no amount of work we could do would change our grade or outcome. During discussions with Dr. Wu on how to facilitate effective learning and improvement, many of the class' ideas were refuted or outright discredited as being too easy, and we felt like we actually had no say or control over how the course was taught."

I think the class being primarily taught practice-based caused me to not be stimulated in some ways

Go to helproom if the homework is confusing. Work hard at the beginning of the semester to do well in the beginning so you have a bit more breathing room with more complex concepts at the end."

It is set up such that you will have to mostly teach yourself, especially if your schedule does not allow you to seek help through help rooms or SAGE (as will probably be the case for most people). The labs are complicated and you receive little guidance from professors and TAs, but you will be graded as if you have an expert understanding of the material. You will have weekly quizzes, pre-class assignments, and problem sets that are not accurately representative of the problems that you are exposed to in class. Not that it particularly matters, because you will have to figure out the steps to solve problems independently of the professor. You will have opportunities for some extra credit, but these will likely not compensate for performance on assessments. Expect to mostly teach yourself and to struggle with the concepts throughout the semester. Otherwise, you would be better off taking physics elsewhere."

The good elements of intellectual stimulation are the concept questions, lecture materials, and homework sets. The homework sets were essential to me applying the content learned in the lecture. The bad elements of intellectual stimulation, which were mentioned earlier, are the limited explanations given for the concept questions. Due to the vagueness of multiple-choice answers, I often found myself unsure of my logic. For instance, I could answer a question correctly, but that doesn't mean my rationale was correct. I wouldn't be able to identify these mistakes or confirm my understanding of the question without further details, which were not immediately available."

Then the professor would want us to do the questions and barely gives us time to do it and when he explains the work he explains super quickly. Half the time he also writes the solution using the laser feature on goodnotes so the solution disappears in 5 seconds without us even being able to understand how to solve the problem. I think the team based groups would be nice if they could be reshuffled halfway through the semester. Honestly the assigned groups were never used in my lab or discussion so I don't think there is any point in going through the trouble of ensuring the people in the groups for lecture are also in the same discussion.

A lot of the teachers/TA's will say ""its easy"" or get quickly frustrated with students when the don't immediately understand a topic which makes it hard for students to learn because they feel pressured to get the concept as soon as its taught or they will be judged. The way topics are explained could be better as well. The teacher will go on tangents about how to derive an equation (when the process of deriving it is not important to the concept, or he has stated that it doesn't need to be known) but doesn't show when students need to start knowing the content leaving it up to students throughout the week to devise which equations and topics, we actually need for the course. If he could establish the concepts more concretely in class that would be great. We only go through concepts (extremely quick without the actually reasoning behind the concept being explained rendering the exercise quick useless) once a week but are expected to know all of the concepts and reasoning behind a topic when it is not lectured nor shown to us."

I also did not like how much time was wasted in lectures instead of doing practice problems. We would often end early. Even now it is the last lecture before exam 3 and we have not done any physics work and its 12:30. I would appreciate if the class did more problems and the concepts were explained through practice problems. Also it would be helpful if the demonstrations were explained more. For buoyancy examples, they would show us something and then that would be it. Explaining the concept live by perhaps writing on the board would be helpful. Overall, this course was one of my least favorite at Duke due to the strong disconnect between lectures and the homework. I feel like topics were given to us but they were never explained clearly.

It was the main method through which I learned the content. Do not just copy down the answers from someone else or wait until discussion to review them. You need to have a good grasp before the quizes.

It is not that different from 141 even though there were adjustments made to this course. I feel there are better places to learn physics if you are not a physics major. If you do not need this class as a Duke credit strongly consider taking it somewhere else.

You'll want to have taken physics in high school or something to help. The instructor is very fast-paced and with the weekly quizzes you have to dedicate significant time out of class to teaching yourself the content and doing homework problems. There is so much work for this class - homework, quizzes, pre-class assignments, and labs every week. Even doing all this work I still found myself failing and Dr. Wu doesn't provide any resources for students struggling with the exam format or large amounts of questions on exams. I will not be taking Physics 2 at Duke."

I went to help room essentially every week, sometimes for two or three hours. I attended one-on-one tutoring sessions again and again. I went to SAGE. I met with my lab partners outside of class. I spent about 15 hours a week on this one course--which is absurd when you consider that an average course load of 4 courses would necessitate 60 hours of work per week if they all required that much time. There were times in SAGE or tutoring sessions when I found physics genuinely interesting, but in the actual class I was so lost and frustrated that I could not possibly find it enjoyable (except occasionally lab)."

The lecture is just to go over 1-2 topics from the assigned readings and solve 1-2 problems. The concept quizzes will still cover stuff from the readings, even if they were not covered in lecture. It is a hard class, but I do think the topics in physics 2 are more interesting than in physics 1. Definitely still need to do math. It will definitely be hard, and it will challenge you constantly. Even if you did the practice problems, the midterm will still be hard and mix up different skills, I'd say. You definitely need to understand the why of physics. Concept-heavy, I'd say. A LOT of formulas to learn. He says it should be intuitive if you understand the why, but honestly, with the time you have to learn all these topics, you definitely have to memorize because it is so hard to learn in depth everything to derive formulas."

The instructor was engaging and passionate about the subject, and he was always eager to answer our questions during class and to make time to help students understand topics outside of class. I would keep the flipped learning style where we read the textbook outside of class and review the content inside of class -- I think it was helpful to be able to take my time in learning the concepts on my own outside of class before the lecture, instead of having to learn it quickly during lecture. I also think that the lecture videos were very helpful because I was able to pause and rewind these videos until I understood a concept I was struggling with."

We can talk to each other in simple terms and in a language that we can understand. I enjoyed having Tyler as a TA, don't get me wrong.

I think this is largely in part because the exams for this class ask incredibly difficult concept questions and are graded such that it is easy to lose a large amount of points very quickly (by nature of being out of small point values, like 20 points). This is a frusrating feeling, because I, like other students, have worked incredibly hard to succeed in this class, and likely harder than I would've worked had I taken this class during a normal fall/spring semester. What feels unfair is that I might end up with a low grade due to the unforgiving nature of the difficult exams, when I feel strongly that had I taken the class at a different time/with a different professor, I think I would've almost certainly be ending with an A."

The actual presentation of the slides was unengaging, often consisting of the instructor simply reading almost word-for-word off of the slides. The lectures were clearly on the fly with no preparation done beforehand, evidenced by the fact that the instructor infrequently knew what he was going to teach about next.
The homeworks were assigned on an clunky online platform. This platform only took into account final answers, meaning details as minute as rounding errors could cause the answer to be completely wrong. In order to redo the incorrect problems to get points back, the platform required that you do the whole problem set again (with different numbers), including the answers you already got correct. In addition, other parts of the homework, like the coding portions, were often vaguely described leaving the student doing lots of guesswork as to what the assignment was.
Rubrics for projects were extremely vague and were, as it turned out, not actually meant to be followed. 
Overall, it was a poorly designed class that had more tedious and arbitrary work than thoughtful, stimulating work."

I also liked them because we were able to immediately correct ourselves with the class if we got the question wrong, so I thought it was a good form of active learning. I also enjoyed hearing about Professor Scolnic's experiences working as an astronomer, even if they weren't the most relevant to the class material. It's not every day you meet someone who works in astronomy, so it was really interesting to hear what that kind of work was like. He was also very receptive to hearing our questions, and I honestly appreciated that he also didn't know everything and was confused about some of the concepts himself.

There's no other way to say it. But as long as you do your best to complete all the work and go to help room for homework and other questions, it is manageable. In my opinion, the best thing to do for physics is to memorize the equations and understand the theory so that you're able to approach every question you're faced with. Going to help room and being able to ask one on one questions is also really helpful because you're able to work through your questions step by step. Discussion is also helpful because you're also able to get step by step guidance, but whichever TA you get will determine how helpful discussion is for you."

He used weekly quizzes, homeworks, discussion, and labs to make sure his students are on track with their learning. I believe all four should definitely kept for future years. In addition, I found the experiments done in class to be in fact very helpful, as a visual learner it helped me put what we learned in lecture into a visual/real life problem. In addition, going over practice problems and developing an algorithm to complete certain homework problems was extremely helpful. In physics sometimes it feels as if there are several equations and routes one can go to solve a problem. Roy, had an algorithm his students should follow, and it greatly helped me."

If you genuinely have excellent preparation, a summer class is perfect. If you haven't, a summer class may be a challenge due to the fact that it is accelerated. Many students have excellent preparation so the course content comes easily to them. If you need more time to understand difficult concepts, this class will be a challenge. You can definitely do it, you might jus not get an A (and that's okay) and you might be very stressed. The summer class itself isn't that bad if you have realistic expectations."

Having a strong foundation in physics helps greatly but you also need to spend time outside of class working out problems yourself to understand the concepts. Dr. Roy is incredibly nice and brings a positive attitude to class. It's better to go into class having read the notes on that topic before class because it can be easy to get a little bit lost during lecture because not everything is laid out in the most introductory friendly way.

Also, take advantage of having the time to use resources like office hours and SAGE. The course is quite fast-paced during the summer, and it may feel overwhelming at first, but you will get used to the pace. Make yourself accountable for doing homework problems every day because it's easy to fall behind. Refrain from committing to responsibilities outside of physics because you'll spend a lot of time in class/lab/discussion and will want time to focus on HW. However, I worked in a lab around 10 hrs/week, which was still manageable."

Summer term physics 141 (Brown and Mckenzie) is not sustainable and is extremely difficult to keep up with. This course meets 6 hours a day with 10+ hours spend after class daily, meaning continued nights of little to no sleep. Physics background in high school will not help you, even 6 years is not helpful. If you have no physics background, it will be like learning an extremely difficult STEM class in a completely foreign language with no time to adjust. This is a class to take if you are majoring in Physics or doing something with Physics in your future, not something to take in order to get your major requirement or prepare for the MCAT."

Summer term physics 141 (Brown and Mckenzie) is not sustainable and is extremely difficult to keep up with. This course meets 6 hours a day with 10+ hours spend after class daily, meaning continued nights of little to no sleep. Physics background in high school will not help you, even 6 years is not helpful. If you have no physics background, it will be like learning an extremely difficult STEM class in a completely foreign language with no time to adjust. This is a class to take if you are majoring in Physics or doing something with Physics in your future, not something to take in order to get your major requirement or prepare for the MCAT."

The class is hard? Yes. What else do you expect from a physics course at Duke. Quizzes are fair. Exams are fair. Tons of office hours.

Also, I think the concept questions were helpful, as well as the added materials (more questions and examples) that I could refer to later to study. The course website was very organized and had a lot of resources that were updated very early on for our reference. The grading scale also seems fair and accommodating, with drops in most categories and fair exams."

If you take this class and have no physics background, learn some physics beforehand or else you're going to have a very very hard time. You do learn SO MUCH but I don't know if it's worth the time and effort. Fortunately, Dr. Wu is a kind man and does give extra credit and opportunities for grade boosts. He says that he ""tries to make the class not stressful,"" which is ...questionable, but I suppose the grade leniency is his way of reducing stress."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The group-based learning is excellent, and I cannot stress this enough. There is a wonderful amount of material available for preparation for quizzes/tests; I find the ICPs very helpful and the problems of the homework that involve deriving and recapitulating core concepts, as well as the concept review itself. The ways in which homework is harder than quizzes, which are somewhat harder than tests (to me, so far), is a good way to help us clear hurdles in this tricky subject without destroying our grades. Dr. Brown is very passionate and knowledgeable, the information tested is very fair, and it is quite clear what is expected of us. I can't speak yet to the final; many classes I've been in have made the final decently harder than midterms, which somewhat defeats the purpose of grade replacement, but so far the midterms at least have felt very reasonable (maybe almost too reasonable, seeing how much of this second midterm we just took seems to have been lifted directly from practice problems)."

The instruction, however, was most definitely not. RGB literally ONLY reads off his slides; I'm about as mathematically inclined as they come in intro physics and even to me it sounded like just pure mathematical gibberish. He means well and is really nice, but god forbid should you ask him a question because that's an easy way to waste two hours of your life away. He will do anything but give a straightforward answer, instead choosing to aimlessly meander among a series of unrelated topics in math and philosophy. He's an incredibly interesting person and, once again, definitely seems to mean well but he sorely needs to be taught a lesson or two in getting to the point. Might be one of the truly rare instances of someone being too smart to teach. Also want to add, his textbook is really thorough but I was unable to understand a lot of it without consulting other texts in conjunction because, while verbose, the book doesn't lay a very good foundation in terms of intuition/derivations for several of the topics.
As for Ken, he's a nice enough person but something about him telling our lab TA to grade our labs harsher and forbidding him from giving us 20/20s on labs rubbed me the wrong way. Physics II isn't a cakewalk as it is, labs are certainly NOT the place to penalize us even more, especially those completed with thought and effort. Labs are super cool though and definitely enhance our physical understanding; could be better designed though, they seem a bit out of touch sometimes and might need more modernization."

His lectures were premade and is the same curriculum used for 162 students. He lectured us in a manner assuming that the conceptual ideas came naturally to us, which made me feel inadequate. I think spending more time explaining the concepts of what we are learning rather than the math would be more beneficial for my retention. I found myself using YouTube a lot more because it was more helpful than his lectures. By the end of the course, half the class stopped attending lectures since we basically learned the entire course by ourselves.

Print out textbook sections before class or use a tablet to take notes on the page. His slides and textbook sections cover almost the same things in the same order and copying everything from the slides onto a blank sheet of paper is exhausting and you will not survive the 3-hour lectures. Save yourself mental capacity by highlighting and annotating the textbook. I learned this too late. 
2. Find a study partner. Someone you are able to share vulnerability with, because in this class you will constantly feel inferior and not enough (at least I did). Knowing that others are feeling the same way really helps. 
3. There are 13 problem sets and I personally spent 12+ hours on each (excluding a few towards the end of the course). I was working every weekend from morning to midnight just like school days and currently I seem to be getting a B at best so I probably invested my time on the wrong things. This is my first physics class since 7th grade; if you are new like me, do not believe in people who say ""RGB gives 2/3 of his class A or A+"" because you will not be one of them. That's OK. Grow at your own pace. You are amazing in your own way. 
4. Office hours do not exist. You have minimal help available. Do not worry about whether the professor will judge you etc.; ask questions whenever you can. 
5. MATH 212/222 (multivariable calculus) helps a lot. 
6. Personally disliked how he refers to students he had since 141 as ""my students"" when discussing relevant 141 material. [e.g. ""My students derived this equation for homework; I don't know whether your professors did the same.""] Like what do you mean, we are all your students. Would really appreciate if he doesn't comment on things like that, or change into something like ""derive this equation in your spare time if you haven't already."" 
7. Randomly cancels class, especially on afternoons, at the cost of rushing through things in the morning. I tried speaking out when he ""takes a poll"" on students' opinion of lecture pace but I seem to be the minority.
8. Labs were fun and manageable."

Not a knock on RGB at all, but his infectious love for physics enhances the experience for those who share that passion too, but can make the class much more difficult and less straightforward for those who are not so inclined. Either way, be prepared for a ton of fun because this class, if you allow it to and really immerse yourself in it, will change your life and how you perceive the universe. A bold statement, I know, but it's true; physics has changed my thought process about *everything* in a way I didn't even conceive was possible. Put in the work and you will definitely be rewarded, not necessarily with grades but definitely with satisfaction and knowledge. Let yourself enjoy physics!!! It's totally worth it."

For more information-packed lectures, though, it was super super hard to keep up. Students wouldn't ask questions because many were confused as the topic matter went right over their heads. I think shortening the 3 hour lecture to 1.5 may be better. Maybe lecture for 45 and then problems for the rest? I also liked that RGB was very friendly. He was very nice and even brought cheesecakes to class once. I also preferred when RGB wrote the lecture on paper. After trying out both hand written notes and powerpoints, hand-written notes wins. I was less likely to pay attention if the lecture was on powerpoint. I felt like RGB structures them better on paper."

When I took it summer term 1 for 141 I had my doubts, but even with the crazy schedule, I feel I enjoyed myself more and retained more information in 142. RGB is also a nice person. If you were to take this class, I'd recommend working on the homeworks during the week so you have the weekend to study the topics you just learned. I'd recommend mastering every problem you see and every resource RGB gives you. Every. Resource. Study for the quizzes 2-3 days in advance. 3 max. Put in the work every week so you do not stress during the exam season. You got this, you can do it."

There is a wonderful amount of material available for preparation for quizzes/tests; I find the ICPs very helpful and the problems of the homework that involve deriving and recapitulating core concepts, as well as the concept review itself. The ways in which homework is harder than quizzes, which are somewhat harder than tests (to me, so far), is a good way to help us clear hurdles in this tricky subject without destroying our grades. Dr. Brown is very passionate and knowledgeable, the information tested is very fair, and it is quite clear what is expected of us. I can't speak yet to the final; many classes I've been in have made the final decently harder than midterms, which somewhat defeats the purpose of grade replacement, but so far the midterms at least have felt very reasonable (maybe almost too reasonable, seeing how much of this second midterm we just took seems to have been lifted directly from practice problems)."

The instruction, however, was most definitely not. RGB literally ONLY reads off his slides; I'm about as mathematically inclined as they come in intro physics and even to me it sounded like just pure mathematical gibberish. He means well and is really nice, but god forbid should you ask him a question because that's an easy way to waste two hours of your life away. He will do anything but give a straightforward answer, instead choosing to aimlessly meander among a series of unrelated topics in math and philosophy. He's an incredibly interesting person and, once again, definitely seems to mean well but he sorely needs to be taught a lesson or two in getting to the point. Might be one of the truly rare instances of someone being too smart to teach. Also want to add, his textbook is really thorough but I was unable to understand a lot of it without consulting other texts in conjunction because, while verbose, the book doesn't lay a very good foundation in terms of intuition/derivations for several of the topics.
As for Ken, he's a nice enough person but something about him telling our lab TA to grade our labs harsher and forbidding him from giving us 20/20s on labs rubbed me the wrong way. Physics II isn't a cakewalk as it is, labs are certainly NOT the place to penalize us even more, especially those completed with thought and effort. Labs are super cool though and definitely enhance our physical understanding; could be better designed though, they seem a bit out of touch sometimes and might need more modernization."

For an easier time, I would have taken a semester's class on multivariable calculus before doing this one."
PHYSICS-142L-001_McKenzie__Ken_Summer_II_2023.html,Summer II 2023,PHYSICS-142L-001 : GENERAL PHYSICS II.PHYSICS-142L-001.,Ken McKenzie,7,What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future?,"1. Print out textbook sections before class or use a tablet to take notes on the page. His slides and textbook sections cover almost the same things in the same order and copying everything from the slides onto a blank sheet of paper is exhausting and you will not survive the 3-hour lectures. Save yourself mental capacity by highlighting and annotating the textbook. I learned this too late. 
2. Find a study partner. Someone you are able to share vulnerability with, because in this class you will constantly feel inferior and not enough (at least I did). Knowing that others are feeling the same way really helps. 
3. There are 13 problem sets and I personally spent 12+ hours on each (excluding a few towards the end of the course). I was working every weekend from morning to midnight just like school days and currently I seem to be getting a B at best so I probably invested my time on the wrong things. This is my first physics class since 7th grade; if you are new like me, do not believe in people who say ""RGB gives 2/3 of his class A or A+"" because you will not be one of them. That's OK. Grow at your own pace. You are amazing in your own way. 
4. Office hours do not exist. You have minimal help available. Do not worry about whether the professor will judge you etc.; ask questions whenever you can. 
5. MATH 212/222 (multivariable calculus) helps a lot. 
6. Personally disliked how he refers to students he had since 141 as ""my students"" when discussing relevant 141 material. [e.g. ""My students derived this equation for homework; I don't know whether your professors did the same.""] Like what do you mean, we are all your students. Would really appreciate if he doesn't comment on things like that, or change into something like ""derive this equation in your spare time if you haven't already."" 
7. Randomly cancels class, especially on afternoons, at the cost of rushing through things in the morning. I tried speaking out when he ""takes a poll"" on students' opinion of lecture pace but I seem to be the minority.
8. Labs were fun and manageable."

Not a knock on RGB at all, but his infectious love for physics enhances the experience for those who share that passion too, but can make the class much more difficult and less straightforward for those who are not so inclined. Either way, be prepared for a ton of fun because this class, if you allow it to and really immerse yourself in it, will change your life and how you perceive the universe. A bold statement, I know, but it's true; physics has changed my thought process about *everything* in a way I didn't even conceive was possible. Put in the work and you will definitely be rewarded, not necessarily with grades but definitely with satisfaction and knowledge. Let yourself enjoy physics!!! It's totally worth it."

For more information-packed lectures, though, it was super super hard to keep up. Students wouldn't ask questions because many were confused as the topic matter went right over their heads. I think shortening the 3 hour lecture to 1.5 may be better. Maybe lecture for 45 and then problems for the rest? I also liked that RGB was very friendly. He was very nice and even brought cheesecakes to class once. I also preferred when RGB wrote the lecture on paper. After trying out both hand written notes and powerpoints, hand-written notes wins.

As someone who took the MCAT before taking physics 2, I feel that some of the work we were doing in class felt more so to prepare us to pursue physics as majors or careers that more heavily involve physics. I understand why a lot of pre-health students at Duke attempt to pursue physics outside of Duke, especially since this class can have a lot of information that may not be helpful for pre-health students. I do think that discussions on lens (especially the eyes) and MRI were very relevant. I hope that in the future, Duke can be more understanding of the physics needs of pre-health students to inspire more students to pursue physics at Duke."

In particular, lecture alone is not enough to understand the material and how to problem solve in this course. Going to discussion and office hours help a LOT with understanding how to apply the material, and they are invaluable experiences in this class. I wouldn't recommend this course for a pre-health student, but you should take this course at Duke if you really like physics, biophysics, or any other major that requires a strong foundation in physics. This course is especially good for people who took AP Physics courses in high school because you will most likely do very well if that's the case.

There is so little ""calculus"" that this is essentially algebra-based AP Physics 1 with slightly harder problems. The midterms were literally easier than the AP Physics exams. This class should be able to be skipped with an AP Physics 1 credit, or at least be able to be replaced with a multivariable calculus physics class after a student has completed a multivar calc course. Truly a waste of time if a student has taken AP Physics 1, though that is not the fault of the instructor or TAs.Basically this should not be a hard requirement if a student hasn't taken Physics C in high school."

The quizzes are worth twice as much as the labs, and you have a new quiz every week. Grading is tough (but reasonable) on assessments but not too bad for labs. Exams are long, and you have to really know the material going into them. If you aren't someone who can learn well from lectures, or if you have trouble concentrating during lectures, find alternative ways to learn the material early on. Don't count on the lectures as a way to learn all or most of the material (even if you are someone who learns well from lectures). Attend every discussion. Arya Roy is listed as one of the instructors, but he almost never lectures.If you have testing accommodations for extra time, know that they do not use the testing center, so if your extra time would cause your exam to extend into another class you'll have to make arrangements with your professor."

I suggest you try to go over lecture notes and the text book before class if you plan on going, as that is the only way to be able to slightly follow along. If you dont have time, dont go to lecture. Read the book, write down the equtions and key points, and try your best to do the hw without looking at the answers. Also try a few of the textbook problems prior to the hw, they are very different, btu can be a good introduction, so that you need the answers less when doing the hw. FInally, go to office hours, if you are lucky, you will find yourself with a group of people and a TA that actually wants to help you, and between the whole group you can get your questions clarified. Also join a sage group, I always found it a little less helpful bc I had it a while before the quiz so i hadnt started to look at the subject for the week yet, but it was still a huge help, and another good way for me to be introduced to the new subjects, since lecture was not doing it for me."

It's a challenging yet rewarding course that provides a solid foundation in mechanics through a blend of theoretical learning and hands-on experimentation.

The quizzes are worth twice as much as the labs, and you have a new quiz every week. Grading is tough (but reasonable) on assessments but not too bad for labs. Exams are long, and you have to really know the material going into them. If you aren't someone who can learn well from lectures, or if you have trouble concentrating during lectures, find alternative ways to learn the material early on. Don't count on the lectures as a way to learn all or most of the material (even if you are someone who learns well from lectures). Attend every discussion. Arya Roy is listed as one of the instructors, but he almost never lectures.If you have testing accommodations for extra time, know that they do not use the testing center, so if your extra time would cause your exam to extend into another class you'll have to make arrangements with your professor."

I suggest you try to go over lecture notes and the text book before class if you plan on going, as that is the only way to be able to slightly follow along. If you dont have time, dont go to lecture. Read the book, write down the equtions and key points, and try your best to do the hw without looking at the answers. Also try a few of the textbook problems prior to the hw, they are very different, btu can be a good introduction, so that you need the answers less when doing the hw. FInally, go to office hours, if you are lucky, you will find yourself with a group of people and a TA that actually wants to help you, and between the whole group you can get your questions clarified. Also join a sage group, I always found it a little less helpful bc I had it a while before the quiz so i hadnt started to look at the subject for the week yet, but it was still a huge help, and another good way for me to be introduced to the new subjects, since lecture was not doing it for me."

The experiments provided a tangible connection to abstract concepts discussed in lectures, and the process of observing phenomena in real time sparked curiosity and deepened my understanding. The challenge of analyzing data, dealing with uncertainties, and refining experimental techniques kept me engaged throughout the course. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the labs allowed for dynamic discussions with peers, which often led to new insights and ways of thinking about problems."

It's a hands-on, engaging course that gives you the opportunity to apply the concepts you learn in lectures directly through experiments. The lab sessions are not just about collecting data but also about developing problem-solving skills, analyzing results, and understanding how theoretical physics translates to real-world applications. You'll have the chance to work closely with your classmates, which makes the experience even more enriching as you share ideas and approaches."

Working in a group to tackle the problems was helpful for understanding the content as you could fill in the gaps of your knowledge by asking questions or strengthen your knowledge by explaining to others."

On top of his poor time management, he came in late pretty often, so that minimized our time even more. He spent too much time answering individual questiosn and not enough time going over the questions as a class, so most people got the short end of the stick. Also, in the beginning of the semester, he would have students come up to the board and write down the answers, which wasn't helpful because discussion's point is for a professional to teach it to me, not another student.

He often gives real-world examples of the phenomena that we discuss and makes it a point of trying to explain complex mathematical ideas in a very intuitive way. He also takes time to connect different lectures and topics to each other so we are able to see the bigger picture and overarching narrative arc of the course as the weeks progress. Topics are presented in a very logical order where later topics build on earlier ones. I enjoyed Derek's demonstrations, which helped me visualize and connect abstract ideas to physical phenomena. We were provided a lot of resources, including homework sets and discussion problems that were helpful for me to process and practice key concepts and also familiarize myself with Professor Roy's problem-writing style, which was useful come exam time. I appreciated that there were lecture notes posted too, which basically allowed me to have two repeats of the same material to really understand it. In lecture, I could focus on picking up as much of the material as possible but rest assured that I could review the lecture notes to solidify/check my understanding afterwards."

However, most of the experiments were interesting enough to ponder and worthwhile to pursue, as each involved some important concepts in experimental physics and data analysis. I would have liked a decreased number of experiments at a more advanced level, perhaps involving more theory. I also think coordinating the schedule better with the introductory E&M course would be beneficial in cutting down the time needed to explain certain topics in class."

I don't know) that we never discussed in class. They are super fun people and I learned from them, but I also had to accept the fact that I performed below average. I doubted myself so many times this semester but I think I learned how to maintain a stable sense of self-worth. It was a very important takeaway. I just wish I didn't think I was alone because I was not alone. And neither are you, whoever is reading this. Life is not a competition with only one winner. That's boring. 
ASK QUESTIONS. Silently studying in your room can only take you so far. Go to office hours, raise your hand in class, politely speak up for yourself when you feel misunderstood. Don't be ashamed, don't be hard on yourself, don't feel bad for taking the professor's time, don't feel bad for taking your classmates' (your more experienced classmates who are asking deep, fundamental questions) time to go back to the basics. It's your learning opportunity as well as theirs. I wish I knew this sooner."

Starting with the former, up until this course, I never really thought to question the claims made within classical physics. This class took that perspective and walked through challenging it in the same way that it was done historically (first with optics, then special relativity, matter waves and ultimately with quantum mechanics. This made the difficult concepts approachable because the questions asked that led to their discovery were the next questions we asked in class - so even though the solutions were a little scary they were simply answers to things that didnt quite make sense. Connecting this all back, this class changed everything I thought I knew about physics - which was hard at times to deal with but made my appreciation and understanding for the subject as research targets it today (which is a whole world within itself I never dug into as I have never pushed beyond the curriculum previously). I feel like I learned A LOT about physics, and I also learned to push beyond what is presented.Further, as a student I feel as though I have grown as well. The concepts were pretty hard for me to grasp and things needed a little extra work to understand. I learned how to push through this discomfort and to not just nod at the steps but to understand why each just is made and why we make it."

I think the course structure overall did not facilitate my learning in a meaningful way. I think moving forward making lectures more engaging and more clear would be better for students overall. Powerpoints are often hard to follow and not engaging and I think their could've been better lectures and more practice problems as a class. I think taking the time to go through the thought process of solving this courses types of problems and giving insight and tips on how to approach them. I think that sending out a survey on coding experience would've been helpful as the difficulty of the coding sets seemed to be a level higher and harder than previous years this course was taught.

His awkward enthusiasm is contagious.
But this class is so, extremely disorganized. Every other page on the lecture notes and homework consists of some typo, which, if you email Cetina, he would confirm promptly the correct version, but there are so, many, typos. He posts practice problems for exams but does not post solutions because he wants us to try working through problems independently, but in reality we're just collectively stuck and, unless you toil through every single office hour with Cetina to confirm your answers, you have little to no study material. He releases pre-class assignments at 12:30 noon and expects them to be completed at 4:40 pm the day of. Homework is tough but if you spend... I don't know, 40 hours? on them, you will improve and get good at mechanics. Exams are difficult, with 60-70% averages. He hasn't yet confirmed he would curve the grades."

The level of instruction is good and lectures are engaging with supplementary knowledge from a reliable textbook, but the amount of content being covered and the difficulty level of that content makes it very difficult to balance between reviewing for class, doing the homework, and studying enough to feel adequately prepared for exams. You will likely feel very lost for most of the class and not perform as well as you would like. Just push through, pay attention to lecture, read the text, and go to office hours."

Exams are tough to do well on not because the questions are actually very difficult, but rather because the grading is unforgiving. For example, it is easy to lose more than half of the points on a question (more than 10% of your exam grade) if you make a simple computation error in part (a) and get deductions in further parts due to carry-through error. Some question parts with computation (that isn't just done within 1-2 steps) are also graded all or almost nothing. So if you want to do well you need to be able to do the questions very quickly and reserve plenty of time to double, triple, or ideally quadruple check all of your answers. Similarly, spend a lot of time on the HW such as with checking all your answers because the HW is 50% of your grade and like exams it can be easy to lose a lot of points."

I don't think I really understand quantum mechanics after this class - maybe that's the beauty of quantum, I don't know. But the class feels like a collection of isolated clusters of ideas and it's not always clear how everything is connected; I feel like I'm being dragged along by a list of key points instead of driven by questions, or gaps in previous knowledge, or the necessity of coming up with completely new ways of doing science.

However, in the last month the course got very abstract and much harder, and the abstraction made me feel like the course was veering into territory that was less relevant to my research interests. This made me stop submitting homework and then attend lecture far less often, and I then put much more effort into my other classes+interests.I don't know if there would've been a way to prevent me from dropping off in the last month; I don't think it makes sense to water down the content.

However, my background is number theoretic, and while a lot of the theory here is absolutely important for my field, there are a lot of topics that I wished we had touched, even if it was just crumbs (Galois representations, representations over Q and fields of positive characteristic, group cohomology, Lie algebra cohomology, algebraic groups, etc). I know a lot of these are unreasonable for a first course, but I think I would be more than satisfiied if some acknowledgement to these was given. Or perhaps instead of a final exam, a final project or a final presentation would be more stimulating. I know I would feel a lot more excitement if I was writing something about these topics rather than worrying about the exam."

Questions were often asked by everyone and the professor and TA took the time to make sure that everybody understood the material before moving on. I think this is advantageous since no one is rushing to simply complete problem sets that they don't have a solid understanding of. On a relevant note, I particularly liked that there was no hard due dates for the problem sets. The sets were very long and provided a good introduction to the material where we could think creatively, and we were encouraged to ask detailed questions rather than just completing them.

For reference, I am coming from an EE background, and I felt like the pace of the lecture was just a bit too fast for me.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Natalie is an excellent communicator of challenging ideas and is deeply attentive to her students and the questions they ask. It felt like an informal and welcoming environment, where we could freely clarify and ask questions or engage in class discussion. The instructor's flexibility with listening to individual students' personal goals for the class helped me to define what I wanted to get out of this class, a question that may not be asked by taking a core class where you can't negotiate with the curriculum. The open ended structure of the course is what was one of the strong points here, as I realise having an x number of topics to get through within a short time period may be unfeasible for a diverse class with different levels of preparation. Having no formal assignments actually encouraged me to put in more effort outside of class. There were days when I would not be in the mood to engage and others where I was more involved, and I enjoyed the freedom that was given to me as I had to focus on the core graduate classes close to exam times. The class flow was directly tailored to the students and it was challenging enough when I chose to engage with it, and often I did happily. I think it was critical to my first semester experience as a sort of safe space amidst the chaos of taking graduate classes and getting used to the setting of grad school. This felt like a class where I knew how much effort I would like to put in and see results in terms of my final self directed plan."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I loved the way that learning objectives were handled and I think this class was vital for me. Going through the basics of quantum mechanics through basis representations and such was a new approach for me and made my mathematics in quantum much stronger. The instructor didn't baby us but gave us a good rundown of concepts and how to do the math related to every concept we learned which was a great approach. Too often, quantum classes just show math and struggle to develop a motivation or fall into pop science communication where the explanations are helpful and engaging but we aren't doing true physics because the math is scant or not there at all. This class is the absolute perfect incorporation of both rigorous mathematics we will need and also the appropriate engaging approach. The pace is fast but that is fine because we are expected to be learning things at our own pace in the background and there was always extra help from the instructor or TA to catch up. In class we often also went over things repeatedly which was a good mind exercise because quantum mechanics is not intuitive and repetition and tying back to past approaches constantly is good."

We had less of a lecture and more of a sit down with someone who led the charge. Obviously the instructor taught the lessons most of the time when students or the TA was not presenting, but I felt talked *to* instead of *at*. Real life experiments were often referenced by the instructor and TA rather than a more abstract approach and I personally loved how concrete that was. The not shying away from advanced topics (muon g-2, bloch sphere, stern gerlacht experiment, qubits, quantum circuit, neutrino oscillations, optics experiments, etc) and applications helped also emphasize that quantum mechanics is more fundamental than classical mechanics and we would often see examples of why and how. Math methods tie ins were frequent and appreciated. This was taught with a physical reference, by physicists who have expertise in the mathematics. It was not a vague math course that sets the tone for some physics. That is the way all quantum mechanics should be taught and I thrived this way."

They forced me to pour into the text and struggle through problems in a constructive manner that left me feeling like I have mastered new concepts. They connected to the lectures well enough to make me feel oriented when looking at the problems, but were not too connected in the sense that I still had to look outside of my class notes to figure out the answer.I also like that the lectures were not straight out of the book. They followed the book titles and the overall roadmap, but went outside the scope of the book in helpful ways to offer a new perspective."

They were incredibly difficult and tested the limits of my understanding. But it was a benefit to my learning to have them formatted this way.

Especially if you don't have a dual degree in math or have not taken an advanced classical mechanics class before. Look to alternative sources of information like Landau or Taylor or online lecture notes. I found that MIT Open Courseware's Classical Mechanics 3 allowed me to complete all homework problems and succeed in this class. Compare reading a 100 page chapter in Goldstein on symplectic notation to 5 pages of lecture notes just to attempt the first homework problem. This is not an intuitive class so be prepared to feel frustrated.

Not only was he great at explaining electrodynamics concepts, but he drew parallels between EM and quantum mechanics or explained how quantum mechanical effects explained some things in EM -- this was a fantastic addition to the course, as it made it more interesting and helped for learning QM.But my favorite thing about Professor Chandrasekharan is that he made me feel intelligent, even when others would say the mistake/misunderstanding I had was ""stupid"" or silly. Anytime I asked a simple question, he never made it seem like I should already know the answer -- he always took the same time and effort answering even basic questions. I did not do too well on the first midterm exam and when I met with him to discuss it and was worried about passing the class, he reassured me that I would still be able to pass AND that the mistakes/misunderstandings I had were not abnormal and quite common for first year physics PhDs, including himself when he was first learning EM.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I really liked how the class was structured. I am not personally a fan of the flipped classroom style of teaching; in every class I've been in that has used this method, I always felt I left with a lesser understanding of the material (I mention this b/c I was asked to talk about the flipped classroom in an email). There was a lot I liked about this class; so, I'm going to break down the things I did like.The lectures were really good. It was clear that Dr. Chandrasekharan (I'll just refer to him as Dr. C from now on) put a great amount of time into learning the material before the lectures so he could answer questions we had confidently. I understand this is not the normal class he teaches; however, it did not feel as such. I thought the lectures and their notes had the important points from the book down and were a great reference to look on during the lectures themselves. I also really liked the examples done in the lecture notes.The homeworks were also very well thought out. Their difficulty was, for the most part, good. I felt that they challenged me to think on the material and ensured I understood the methods described in class. I did like how for the problems that were longer and more challenging there were hints that guided us through.The office hours for the class were also very helpful. Every time I went I knew that I would leave with my question answered and a greater understanding of the course material. If I had a question on a homework problem, Dr. C wouldn't just give us the answers to the problem, but would help work it out with us so that we understood the entire process. I remember there was one office hours that about 15 people showed up to ask questions. That's the sign of a good professor.The last thing I will touch on is how I felt comfortable asking questions in Dr. C's class and office hours. I knew that if I asked a question I wouldn't be talked down to as if my question was stupid, but rather the complete opposite. He would encourage the question and touch on why it was important to understand the material. I remember one day in his office hours me and a few other students were asking about a problem dealing with free current. While discussing our misunderstanding of the question, he noticed that we were approaching the problem the wrong way. He then mentioned the problem was tricky for him as well and that even he had attempted to do the same thing we did at first. Even though it was a small comment, it stuck with me as it made him feel (I know this is going to sound weird), but human. I feel like many professors I've had in the past are quick to put up this persona of being incapable of being wrong, and that always felt intimidating. However, that one comment from Dr. C made me feel the complete opposite."

I know Shailesh spent many hours preparing them and having the notes available to us in advance - thank you!!! 
I do think that the lecture notes could have been a bit more detailed, especially in terms of explaining worked examples. The examples in Zangwill typically are not easy and involve references to many previous examples, and are ""worked"" in the text without showing many of the key steps. I think I could have avoided a lot of confusion by using class time to explain the detail of examples - if we want to gloss over how the problem is solved, we can just read the book.
I also wish the lectures did a bit more to discuss methods of problem solving - there is almost always a simple algorithm to go through solving problems (even though the calculations are involved - can't avoid that) that you have to figure out by truly ""digesting"" the material. But, it is usually very hard to ""digest"" the material and come away with the most important and practical points simply by reading the textbook. Lectures can help with this immensely! As a key example: Zangwill chapter 4. The actual concepts are quite simple, and their implementation is as well. But it was very convoluted in Zangwill."

This seems to be the only student quality that matters. But the course is virtually only exams. Homework was 20% of the grade and 80% was exams. The average grade on the first midterm was essentially a 50%. While I understand this is graduate physics and grades are often 'curved' later (how exactly final grades get determined numerically in these graduate physics classes remains a mystery to me), I find it really disappointing that this is considered acceptable. Normally, a class average like this is a reflection of the teacher. I want to make it very clear that qualities like improving over the course of the semester, being proactive and communicative in your studies, and engaging outside of class are absolutely not taken into consideration when grading. You will be graded exclusively by how you compare numerically to the rest of the class. I also want to point out that when studying for any major exam (MCAT, LSAT, SAT, GRE, etc.) the main study method is practice exams, including students studying to take the qualifiers in the Duke Physics Dept. before they were removed. If courses are currently intended to be stricter and harsher to compensate for removing the qualifiers, then they should at least be held to the same test-taking standards. Shailesh denied providing any guidance or previous/practice exams for studying when asked. We were given a set of lectures with ambiguous start/end points to study from that encapsulated a triple digit number of pages in the textbook and nothing else. Even the formula sheets we were allowed to make were useless when trying to predict what the exam would be about."

We also had the weekly review sessions in an attempt to help with the homework. Most of the work in the course went into the homework assignments that were due every other week. These were difficult to complete and very time consuming, and  almost wholly unrelated to the exam content, which had much shorter problems and was more focused on advanced undergraduate level material - meaning if you didn’t come in with a solid foundation, you'd have to make it up on your own time because engaging with the course content itself wouldn't necessarily help you on the exam. To study for the exam, you needed to pay close attention to the content covered on the practice exam.

As Professor Liu always says ""nothing fancy"", ""no more than 2-spin system"", ""no more than Harmonic Oscillator"". Such saying sounds funny, but actually pass me a question with answer, which is ""Are we able to learn all the materials of QM?"", ""NO!"". So, how to learn QM or anything else? I believe Professor Liu gave a good answer, which is to grasp the idea and origin, understand several examples and most importantly, to figure out what is a math highly involved problem but already solved (like special functions) and what is a scientific research problem (like a Hamiltonian hard to solve). I learned that we can never learn everything for any subject or topic, but it is not a shame, it is normal. The importance is to seek the basis thing and to appreciate the whole picture. So, I learned that I should not be afraid of anything looks ""fancy"", just to learn and to ask question. In this sense, Professor Liu teaches me such spirit and render me to be confident to face anything looks fancy in the future."

I enjoyed most of the presentations, even if they weren't something I was interested in researching personally. I do think it might be easier to get higher engagement if the class is at a more normal time.

But the payoff there doesn't require the timing; it is a large investment to plan the weekly schedule in such a way to make considerations for this course but also spend long hours on other vital things. That being said, I think all students should have a familiarity with what is being done at Duke in Physics so I have no issue with mandatory attendance.

However, the class is not based on a textbook nor fixed syllabus, so the takeaways from the class are not rigorous at all. As a physical sciences student, this class has been mostly useless towards building a foundation in quantum. The lack of rigor and a systematic approach has made things intellectually frustrating. The final project—a TikTok-style video—is for entertainment purposes only and could be intellectually stimulating depending on how you see it."

Roughly half of the class is in STEM, while the other half is in economics. In terms of taking a cool, effortless course that knocks off an NS code, this seminar is the best of the best and very ideal. The only ""workload"" is literally going to and back from DQC. For me as a physical sciences student, I have only regrets. How I wish I audited this course. On the bright side, I am happy that I could visit DQC twice a week and meet several like-minded peers. On the other hand, I wasted one full credit this semester that could have been allocated to a real physics course like PHYS 163. Please do note that in the future, PHYS 89S may have a different topic and different instructor. Prof. Monroe is a great guy and delivers lighthearted lectures with a good (and occasionally dark) sense of humor, but could come in unprepared and make mistakes during lectures."
