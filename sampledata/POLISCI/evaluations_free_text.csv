- Exploring current events. It is interesting, but also primarily one sided, to hear Professor Feaver interpret ongoing conflicts. 
- Had to learn how to accept ""failure"". Especially within the PoliSci department at Duke there is a fair amount of grade inflation. This may be one of the only courses you take where effort does not correlate to grades, and there is no possible way for you to receive an A on every assignment, let alone the majority of all assignments, no matter how much time you put into the course outside of class."

It's truly not worth the amount of time the course demands from readings, flipped lectures, in class lectures, discussions, assignments, and preparing for weekly NYTs quizzes. If you're thinking about concentrating in IR, I would genuinely advise you to reconsider. I will say, Peter Feaver is a star in his field and is absolutely an expert. However, he is far from unbiased and if you end up taking the course, be sure to keep his background in mind and take America first sentiments with a grain of salt."

I also liked how we had the chance to get feedback on essay drafts ahead of time to improve for the final draft.

It is a good class to get a general and broad overview of political philosophy. With that said, I would probably wait until at least sophmore year to take it with a couple polisci classes under your belt because the way that the class is graded makes it so that you are compared to your peers very heavily. The grading is a bit harsh but, for the most part, understandable and deserved. Joseph is a great TA and if you want to learn how to be more of an analytical thinker, definitely try to get him."

I had the chance to Zoom with him outside of class, and he gave me constructive and specific feedback that proved very useful for my essay.

The material can feel abstract and dense, and if that’s not your learning style, it might be hard to stay motivated. That said, try to put in as much effort as you can on the essays, because they’re your best chance to show what you’ve understood. If you are open to the challenge, and especially if you’re curious about how foundational political theories still shape the world today, the course could be worthwhile."

The whole idea of Enlightenment philosophy is extremely interesting. It is so apparent that the United States was a direct result of Enlightenment understandings; it was always so cool to see the ideas of these thinkers still relevant hundreds of years later.

For one, we never truly compared the beliefs of the authors, as we'd talk about one author for a few weeks (usually for far too long), then another author after that, but never actually consider how their arguments intersect or contrast. Additionally, there were zero activities this semester that asked us to work with peers, which seems curious given that philosophy is a field that requires dialogue. Instead, it was just lecture after lecture, with no change in pace for the entire semester, and even though we talked in class, it was always for the purpose of clarifying one of many confusing points, or to answer one of Professor Gillespie's notoriously tricky question. Occasionally varying class structure and allowing for collaboration would make class far more engaging and would encourage us to invest more time into the readings. Especially with how convenient it would be for us to work in groups, how about occasionally having us do group projects, rather than a reading or essay assignment? I guarantee that would increase excitement, much like the projects in our other focus classes have."

You can use the resources of the TA, your fellow classmates, and the Professor himself to figure out what doesn't make sense to you. Professor Gillespie moves quickly in class, so get ready to be typing a lot. Oftentimes, when it came to essay writing, I would pull from my class notes to comprise arguments and premises. I would compare these notes with my reading notes to form what would end up being my paper. In this way, writing papers was never a struggle. Do most of the readings, use your resources, check online summaries of readings, and take good notes, and you will find this class do-able if not enjoyable. Also, be prepared to get low(ish) marks on your papers. This class is no layup."

I used to look at the lack of education for example and think about building a school. But in this class I learned that the societal status quo can often be traced back to how to the system is designed.Another one of my biggest takeaways is that history can teach us a lot about how to organize our societies better. I used to think that the emerging technology and lifestyle means that we have to think from scratch about designing our society; but this class showed me that there are some underlying timeless lessons about humanity that we can use to make a good society. In our readings we looked at the Roman empireAnother big takeaway for me is that I am beginning to get a roadmap to understanding why politicians do what they do. I was recently reading about decisions taken by Kais Said, Tunisia’s president, and I realized that he was giving himself more executive power like we read in “how democracies die”. It feels so satisfying to go from seeing politics as this confusing and overwhelming world where it seems like everyone must be so smart and strategic to reducing to some textbook strategies that have been used and re-used over history."

It was the highlight of my freshman year.

De Marchi answers any questions we have thoroughly and it's obvious that he really wants to help us understand not just how to do data analysis but how to do it well/ethically. De Marchi also gives good advice about college and what classes to pick which is a helpful perspective for first semester freshmen.

My favorite part of this course was the problem set structure. Often, concepts discussed in class did not make much sense until I began working through the problem set. Then I'd have a ""eureka"" moment and things would fall into place. I felt empowered to do that because I knew that my first attempt at both the R coding and problem sets were preliminary.

Like many other graduate students, I was drawn to political science for its substantive themes and topics and was basically terrified about taking on the quantitative side of things, especially as I did not have any prior quantitative training in my academic background. I am grateful to him for making math less scary by being incredibly encouraging, and repeatedly working to dispel the notion that people who don't get things on the first try will never quite get it. He also encouraged questions and was vocal about there being no stupid questions, which was hugely helpful especially in the context of the first semester of graduate school.

Additionally, maintaining the interactive lecture style where students are encouraged to ask questions at any time is invaluable for ensuring active engagement.

Just be prepared to spend about half your working time each week on this class.

On your own, keep a list of common commands or functions. A sort of cheat sheet that you can easily refer back to. Become familiar and comfortable with using the R help function. Finally, don't be afraid to ask Dave math questions. He is very kind, and understanding, and knows that we are all coming from very different math backgrounds. He is there to help and will!"

I know there were concerns about people reading ahead in the slides if they were released early, but it would actually have been conducive to my comprehension to have the slides ahead of time so I would know what my weaker areas of understanding are and come to class with questions."

Individually, Jon was very helpful and it's clear he's passionate about the subject, so maybe I would have had a better time in this class if I already had a strong coding background."

And make sure to finish all the readings before lecture every week, which will be greatly helpful for you to catch up with the fast-paced lectures. Go over the slides after class, I think the slides are the most condensed and complete guide for this course. Last but not least, taking this course may be a struggle but you will learn a lot after going through."

In his TA Session, I exactly learned nothing. It's obvious that he showed no evidence of preparing for the lab in advance. It was painfully clear that he had not prepared in advance: he struggled to locate even the correct questions in the book during the lab, despite the session being explicitly designed to help us work through the weekly problem sets. On multiple occasions, his explanations were not only uninformative but outright incorrect, creating more confusion rather than clarifying the material. His lack of preparation and grasp of the content severely undermined the purpose of the lab sessions."
