I learned about Arabic grammar concepts like noun sentences, verb sentences, pronoun endings, etc. and I also learned to keep myself humble about what I do not know and do know, since I thought I knew way more about the Arabic language than I actually did."

He is really clear, helpful, informative, and encourages us to ask questions if anything is unclear. This is super helpful for students who don't already have a background in Arabic.

The lecture combined a balanced combination of speaking, reading, listening, and writing activities, and I rarely felt unprepared for quizzes or homework based on his instruction alone. I definitely think that the communication between Professor Badr and the discussion section made sure that we were using our time as a class effectively and in a way that combined learning new material and reviewing well. Also review games like Kahoot were so fun for the class, and I would have loved to do more to test my knowledge!"

I made so many new friends that I hang out with almost daily (which as a sophomore is not common). On top of that, there's so much intricacy in the Arabic language that I could feel my brain expanding as we learned different concepts. For example, almost all Arabic words can be traced to a three letter root, which you can use to ascertain the meaning of the word (for example, the root d-r-s is related to studying—""dars"" is ""lesson"", and ""yadros"" is ""to study"")."

It did more than introduce me to a new language – it opened doors to learning about a rich, living culture, and to an appreciation for the ability of language to bridge borders. If all people would learn this course, I firmly believe that it would bring people together and heal divisions. Three lessons stand out:A Deeper Paradigm Shift in Language Acquisition: For me now, Arabic is no longer simply a language—any more than literature, art, or music is just language. This course instructed me on how to hear not only words, but the essence of language. Learning to express myself in Arabic provided me a sense of belonging to a greater global culture, opening new levels of empathy and comprehension.Cultural Awareness beyond Words: By studying Arabic, I have also come to admire the richness of cultural history, art, and philosophy that lie within this language. Through this course, I have been made aware of the ways language can serve as an access point to the soul of a people and, thereby, a more profound respect for global diversity and humanity.Empowerment Through Language: I have come to understand that language is an empowering tool, one that can bring people together and spark change. Beautiful and yet complex, Arabic is more than a skill--it is a force that can bridge divides and unite people. This course made me feel confident to engage the world in a more impactful and deeper way. In short, this course hasn't just broadened my language capacities, but it also triggered a deep personal shift. It provided me with a new perspective for seeing the world—and I am confident that this new knowledge will continue to steer me for many years."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I think having 2 days with Ustadh Badr and 1 day with Ustadh Saad was a great way to keep the course stimulating considering they have different teaching styles and bring different things to the table. Having weekly homework is very helpful in practicing the skills we learn in class, as well as the quizzes every few weeks to make sure we are really engaging with the grammar and vocabulary. Having one midterm and multiple quizzes throughout the semester was more helpful to me than having 2 or 3 high-stake midterms in addition to the final. Also having the presentation at the end of the semester helped make me more comfortable with my speaking/presenting skills in Arabic."
