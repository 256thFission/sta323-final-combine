2.

3. I also learned how to be a more effective & analytical learner — Dr. Huettel emphasized that understanding was key to learning (rather than memorizing). I also sharpened my knowledge application skills by actively generating my own questions (relating to the course content) and critically analyzing research (& other forms of evidence provided to substantiate theories)."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Firstly, I really liked how we were able to apply our learning multimodally through many different components — we completed both timed exams and written assignments, which allowed me to hone a wide range of transferable skills. Studying for an exam, for instance, helped me develop my awareness of time management and effective study strategies, while the writing assignments trained my ability to write clearly and concisely. In terms of the 'Class Participation' component of our grade, I really liked our weekly Slack discussion posts, and agree that Slack is an accessible and easily navigable platform to host the discussion posts. I also really liked how office hours occurred over Zoom, as this made them much more accessible.Beyond that, in regards to Dr. Huettel, our TAs (Christina and Qiaochu), and the learning environment that they created, I would definitely say that I felt supported — I was able to reach out to them super easily, whether it be speaking with them in person after class or sending them emails (which I would receive quick replies to), and I felt encouraged and empowered to raise my hand in class despite sitting in a crowd of over 100 students (Dr. Huettel was awesome at creating a judgment-free environment, where he encouraged us to disregard failure and the fear of providing a 'wrong' answer). Part of this was due to how engaging the class environment was in general, and while a big reason for this was how engaging of a speaker Dr. Huettel himself was (he delivered information through vivid stories and examples in such memorable ways (with humor too); a student on RateMyProfessors described his lectures as super interesting TED Talks, and I agree!), it's also because Dr. Huettel only released the lecture slides after the lecture itself, which kept everyone present.In terms of timed exams, the mini-exam (worth 3% of our grade) we took at the start of the semester was also a great incentive for me to stay on top of my content review while also understanding the systems of thinking used within the Decision Science field (reflected in the questions presented). More importantly, the mini-exam offered a small buffer for 'failure,' which I could learn from (without the 'failure' affecting my overall grade too consequentially)."

Additionally, even though I did take psychology in high school (IBDP Psychology at the Standard Level), this class added so many more dimensions to what I already knew, particularly in terms of the applications of knowledge; for the 'Heuristics' topic, for example, while I knew from high school that heuristics were essentially mental shortcuts used when making a decision, this class added context to it (that heuristics form due to the existence of structure in the world, which makes certain phenomena more predictable) and delved into additional detail (e.g., examples of heuristics such as the fluency heuristic and one-clever-cue heuristics). Dr. Huettel's information delivery during lectures also aided in this — he actively asked us questions during his lectures, and the way he structured his slides was super organized and easy to understand (for example, Dr. Huettel included a summary slide at the end of every slideshow; he also underlined all the key concepts and created a key terms guide for us to use while studying)."

This also encodes the knowledge in your brain more easily!
2) Actively generate examples for each concept/theory, and remember the theories that way. This helps massively with understanding.
3) Use spaced repetition when studying — create a study schedule for yourself where you regularly review content (and generate examples while reviewing them, etc.!). This works far better than cramming in terms of information retention & overall understanding. (Trust me, I was a crammer, and studying last-minute was hellish — realizing how enlightening the concepts were while studying was awesome, but doing that last-minute (with tons of other topics to review) was not.)
4) Go to Office Hours — Dr. Huettel (as well as Christina and Qiaochu, and undoubtedly whichever TAs you get) provided so much clarification and extra insight on the different topics we learned in class! Dr. Huettel's Office Hours are also over Zoom, which makes them super accessible.All of this is also advice that Dr. Huettel imparted to us at the start of the semester — basically, I'd advise students to FOLLOW DR. HUETTEL'S ADVICE in regards to learning and studying! He's an expert at these kinds of things, and he's been teaching for 25 years — studying behavior and how to optimize it is literally his field of study."

Professor Vanberg is an excellent, incredibly knowledgeable teacher who really wants his students to succeed. If you are interested in the realm of game theory and how it applies to social sciences and real-world interaction, definitely take this course. And if you work hard and engage in class, your grade should be fine. I will say, I took this class because I loved Decision Science 101, and I found that that course is a bit more Psych-y and concepts-based than this one, which goes into detail and does a lot more mathematical practice with game theory. I still really liked it, though."

Having said that, while the class is initially very easy, especially if you have a basic understanding of game theory, it quickly ramps up in intensity and difficulty towards the latter half of the semester. While not insanely mathematical, it is definitely a quantitative course and the exams often give little time to solve complex problems. If you really want to guarantee an A, do not take this course unless you can dedicate a good amount of effort and time to the course as it escalates in difficulty. The grading scheme this semester for exams led to very high-variance outcomes: Relatively large portions of your grade could be lost by very silly mistakes and there were few partial credit opportunities. It is pretty easy to get a solid grade but very hard to get a very good grade."

The Mob Lab games and other interactive activities also were very helpful. I would say leaning more into the interactive part of the class would make it even more intellectually stimulating.

Sometimes lectures were a bit more dense but that's because there may have been a lot of explaining required around some dense topics - I don't think it was ever because of the instruction but rather because there are sometimes more dense concepts we have to learn.

I loved. The second half of the class is definitely harder so make sure to keep on top of it

Professor Vanberg is an excellent, incredibly knowledgeable teacher who really wants his students to succeed. If you are interested in the realm of game theory and how it applies to social sciences and real-world interaction, definitely take this course. And if you work hard and engage in class, your grade should be fine. I will say, I took this class because I loved Decision Science 101, and I found that that course is a bit more Psych-y and concepts-based than this one, which goes into detail and does a lot more mathematical practice with game theory. I still really liked it, though."

Having said that, while the class is initially very easy, especially if you have a basic understanding of game theory, it quickly ramps up in intensity and difficulty towards the latter half of the semester. While not insanely mathematical, it is definitely a quantitative course and the exams often give little time to solve complex problems. If you really want to guarantee an A, do not take this course unless you can dedicate a good amount of effort and time to the course as it escalates in difficulty. The grading scheme this semester for exams led to very high-variance outcomes: Relatively large portions of your grade could be lost by very silly mistakes and there were few partial credit opportunities. It is pretty easy to get a solid grade but very hard to get a very good grade."
