Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned a lot more about policy analysis, which was very useful because I wasn't familiar with that type of writing previously. Specifically in the way that policy analysis is a combination of political theory, economics, science, and overall understanding. I think it was also very helpful to learn more about the application of this knowledge in a shareable and often focused context whether that be in an analysis of a specific person or the form of discussion posts or the form of a podcast. It was all great! Lastly I think that I learned a lot about how to recognize that all sides have a reason and that none should be ignored for that reason."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned a lot about how policy at mostly the federal level impacts the US's progress in the renewable energy transition. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act helped me gain a better understanding of how a policy plan can have a drastic effect on our energy sources. I also learned about how foreign policy has impacts across economic and resource-related sectors. I gained an appreciation for the work done by smaller businesses and governments towards making this transition possible."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First, I learned about the general structure of the current energy system, including the ways that energy is currently produced, transmitted, and harnessed around the world. We learned why it is this way, and the benefits and drawbacks of the current system, including climate change. We learned about how the energy system is related to policy and the economy. Later in the course, we dived into the idea of the energy transition, why it is happening, and what current policies are fueling it. I learned to think about energy, and other issues, with a wider lens that does not just include my feelings on the subject."

I also think the essay-writing was beneficial for me as an independent assignment because both my writing and critical thinking skills improved.

I would have added at least one final paper check-in, however, to keep everyone at a good pace and force people to have an instructor check if their paper was going in the right direction. I enjoyed the conversation-based classes and the guest-speaker led lectures. Those were very engaging and interesting."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Having three professors was definitely one of the greatest strengths of the course given the variety of expertise we were exposed to from individuals in different backgrounds studying the same issue, as well as the accessibility and support that came with a low student to teacher ratio. I also would highly recommend maintaining the style of an information-heavy first half of the class, and an exploration-centric second half (guest speakers, projects, etc.)."

This made the class very interactive which helped provide great context for the subject. Dr. Brian Murray is an incredible teacher, largely because he is very knowledgeable about all parts of energy, with particular specialties in energy policy and economics. He brought in a lot of guest speakers with very different roles and opinions on energy, which made the class different every day. 
In the future, the course should definitely keep Dr. Murray and his style of teaching, and the guest speakers."
