I also had never written an ethnography before and found that experience to be incredibly eye opening - learning that observation is a skill will continue to be instrumental throughout my career.

You will learn a lot about the linguistics field while covering many topics related to the intersections of language, policy, and history. The readings are all manageable with time in class for group discussion and reflection. Dr. Price has fair expectations and incredibly detailed essay rubrics (the most detailed that I've ever seen, actually) while still remaining flexible based on what students want to focus on. Take this course!"
