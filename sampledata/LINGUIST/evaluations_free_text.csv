I didn't realize the professor didn't until it was too late.  There were only general topics but I had no idea about how much reading was expected of us (more than 100 pages of academic journals per week). The same goes for the collaborative mini projects, which had no due dates, which made it difficult to plan ahead. I did not like how one was due shortly after spring break. Overall, I did not like how the syllabus was not clear. In all my other readings-heavy classes, weekly readings expectations are clearly listed in the syllabus and posted in Sakai beforehand so we have a taste of what we have to read. The professor posted each batch of readings a few weeks before and I had no idea what or how much was expected. 
- I did not enjoy how classes went more than 5 minutes over nearly every single session. 
- I also did not enjoy cold calling."

You don't necessarily need a background in any of them to succeed, because Liu laoshi is willing to help you through it, but I think it helps in being able to understand the concepts faster. I only knew a little Chinese, and I had taken a linguistics course the semester before taking this class, and I think my linguistics knowledge made up for my Chinese knowledge. I think most other people in the class had a bit more background in Chinese but not as much in linguistics, so it depends. However, everyone was able to produce pretty successful research projects by the end of the semester, and there's a place for everyone's interests in the research project! I will say, the course can be a lot of reading at times, and the research project can be time-consuming depending on how you're collecting your data, so I would keep that in mind as you're balancing courses. My biggest takeaway from the course, though, is probably getting to learn more about my friends and their cultural experiences, so I would say that was worth it."

Through several good experiences in classes in the past and I had slowly built up a rough framework for categorizing what makes a good professor. However, now that I have finished LING211, I can say without a doubt that not only does Professor Osborne surpass that bar, I think she's ruined Duke professors for me in the future. I don't think anyone else can live up to her gold standard. Not only is she the single nicest professor I've ever had, she goes out of her way to help you succeed in things even outside the class. Whether that includes helping you understand small concepts from class or even discussing the best job opportunities for you specifically, she really cares about her students, in a way that is rarely seen. If you have a chance to take a class with her before you graduate (as most people in her classes are upperclassmen), DO IT. With my time at Duke nearing the end, I can safely say that Professor Osborne was the highlight of my Duke experience. I'm even taking another course with her in the spring, as I cannot bear to go a semester without having her as a teacher."

You don't necessarily need a background in any of them to succeed, because Liu laoshi is willing to help you through it, but I think it helps in being able to understand the concepts faster. I only knew a little Chinese, and I had taken a linguistics course the semester before taking this class, and I think my linguistics knowledge made up for my Chinese knowledge. I think most other people in the class had a bit more background in Chinese but not as much in linguistics, so it depends. However, everyone was able to produce pretty successful research projects by the end of the semester, and there's a place for everyone's interests in the research project! I will say, the course can be a lot of reading at times, and the research project can be time-consuming depending on how you're collecting your data, so I would keep that in mind as you're balancing courses. My biggest takeaway from the course, though, is probably getting to learn more about my friends and their cultural experiences, so I would say that was worth it."

I think the content was really interesting and made me thing a lot about my own fluency. The workload isn't too heavy. Usually read a research paper that is anywhere from 15-20 pages and come up with some critiques and future studies that would be interesting based on the study. The papers are usually pretty interesting.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Before coming into this class, I was unfamiliar with linguistic rights and the issues that indigenous communities face with maintaining the presence of their communities. I learned a lot about the challenges inherent to language revitalization and the steps and support necessary to successfully revitalize a community's language. This course fostered a lot of discussion, and Profe Paredes imparted so much of her knowledge and experience on us, and I feel much more knowledgeable on the subject than I did previously."
