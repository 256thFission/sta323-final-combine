She was always understanding, willing to help/answer questions, and made sure to ask frequently if there were questions. She facilitated my engagement with the course by being amiable and encouraging us to be immersed in the culture and to learn to make the language our own. She especially put up with any strange side tangents I came up with or comments I had which I think was integral to my investment in the class and language as a whole. I loved how the German department gave ample opportunities to engage with the department and learn outside of class as well, including interacting with German speakers at different levels/in different classes."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Leonhardt is incredibly engaging! From the first day of the lecture, I admittedly felt intimidated since she initially spoke in German, but hearing her lecture in German instead of English is helpful in the transition to higher-level German classes. Over time, I felt that her way of teaching by lecturing in German helped me retain more words and learn much faster than if she had taught primarily in English.Additionally, she is very understanding and compassionate! Beyond lectures, she is always a helping hand outside of class and has been very approachable during office hours. I have stayed on top of work throughout the semester, but there were times when I found I was struggling with extenuating circumstances, such as family and mental health, and she has always been incredibly supportive in working with me to make sure I succeed in this class. I can confidently say she strives to ensure every student in her class does well to prepare for higher German classes. I am truly thankful and honored to have had Leonhardt as my professor, and she inspired me to consider studying abroad as a potential plan in later semesters.Lastly, I enjoyed the curriculum of the course, namely self-grading homework assignments (based on how well we felt we performed), extra credit opportunities with Kulturpunkt, regrading opportunities (e.g. in-class writing assignments), and dropped grades (e.g. drop lowest quiz at end of the semester).  This put significantly less stress and anxiety on me academically and enabled me to enjoy learning German more. I hope they continue doing this in future semesters."

It gives me a chance to share any insights I make from the readings and hear what other insights the people around me might have made that I missed. Therefore giving me a more understanding perspective of each reading that I discuss with others around me. It helped me learn better about the different components in class. Also doing an actual D&D one-shot helped me understand what we talked about in class about the subject and how it connects to the fantasy genre.

Furthermore, I developed the ability to ""piece together"" information and fill the gaps that I have in my knowledge given a certain context. For example, if there's something I don't know, I can pretty much figure it out myself, which gives me somewhat of an independent learning skill. Finally, my German language skills have drastically improved, and I feel like I can now understand most of what people are saying in trivial contexts."

I feel like I need a bit of that no-BS attitude to actually learned because I learned more German than I have ever before in my other classes. I think it can be really tough to not make a student feel stupid when they're learning a new language, but no matter how long it took me to get a topic, Luca has never ever made me feel like I couldn't do it because he's always so encouraging.

This course is very flexible and like I said student-driven. You will get a lot of material but it is the student's job to go further and make those Quizlets to learn the vocab and practice the new grammar by implementing new tenses into your projects. Participation is also another major way you improve your skills. The class is basically an hour of speaking practice three times a week.

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently.

This essay will show how this underlying dynamic shapes both debates over AI regulation and the longstanding capitalism versus communism controversy.In the current debates surrounding AI regulation, especially around deepfake imagery and disinformation, the divide is sharp. Anti-regulation advocates adopt an ideology-first stance, prioritizing principles of free speech absolutism and market autonomy. Organizations like the Cato Institute frame any attempt to regulate AI content as a slippery slope to censorship or dangerous government overreach. Similarly, the narrative that ""innovation must be free from interference"" dismisses the material harms caused by AI disinformation — such as manipulated election outcomes, voter suppression, and the erosion of public trust. The underlying ideological commitment to liberty and free market operation remains firm even in the face of mounting evidence that AI technologies, left unchecked, can profoundly destabilize democratic institutions.Conversely, pro-regulation advocates adopt a material-first position, focusing not on preserving ideological purity, but on minimizing measurable harm. They prioritize policies like mandatory watermarking of AI-generated media, platform accountability for disinformation campaigns, and transparency requirements for algorithmic content distribution. Their arguments are grounded in concrete evidence: AI models have exacerbated biases in hiring, deepened misinformation flows, and enabled new forms of exploitation and surveillance. Rather than focusing on deontological arguments about abstract rights, material-first proponents insist that preventing real-world damage must take precedence, even if it entails some limitations on absolute free expression or market freedom.This structure mirrors the capitalism versus communism debate throughout the twentieth century. Capitalist apologetics frequently operated from an ideology-first perspective, framing free markets and competition as ""natural"" forces immune to political critique. Ideologies of meritocracy — that wealth and success reflect personal virtue — mystified systemic inequalities, obscuring the exploitation and structural violence embedded in global capitalism. Even as ecological collapse, labor precarity, and extreme wealth gaps became more visible, defenders of market ideology dismissed these harms as ""externalities"" rather than evidence of fundamental flaws. Their loyalty remained not to empirical outcomes but to the abstract sanctity of market competition.On the other side, critiques of capitalism — including socialist and communist thought — adopt a material-first approach. These critiques prioritize harm reduction: alleviating poverty, protecting ecological systems, ensuring workers' rights, and reducing systemic inequality. They are less concerned with preserving the ideological purity of economic ""freedom"" and more concerned with minimizing the tangible suffering produced by capitalist systems. Whether through labor protections, wealth redistribution, or environmental regulation, material-first critiques demand that abstract ideals yield when faced with material devastation."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","In the traditional model of ideological control, elites dominate mental production by distributing first-order ideological content: direct messages about what is true, good, or desirable. However, this is no longer the only — or even the primary — mechanism. In the contemporary world, not only does mental production distribute first-order ideology, but also the enforcement of second-order ideology additionally distributes first-order ideology. Seemingly neutral frameworks like ""free speech,"" ""anti-misinformation,"" and ""anti-hate speech"" are second-order ideologies that not only prescribe how the media should distribute first-order content but universalize first-order values through their enforcement. Thus, the public inherits first-order ideologies not only from the media itself but derive them from universal prescriptions of what kinds of communication are deemed legitimate.Consider ""misinformation"" enforcement. During the Cold War, elites not only flooded the media with anti-communist messages; they also framed sympathy toward communism itself as ""misinformation"" or ""subversion."" Thus, communism being bad was not only simply conveyed through the arguments the media made, but through ruling the discussion of alternatives as inherently illegitimate and a form of misinformation. In this context, ""misinformation"" as a second-order ideology was a direct extension of a first-order ideological battle: capitalism versus communism.In today's technocratic context, however, ""misinformation"" serves a different second-order function. The contemporary enforcement of ""misinformation"" on the surface seems to be a simple second-order filter for accuracy. However, such a filter spreads a universalist belief in objective truth — the idea that there exists a singular, recognizable reality that must be protected and disseminated for the sake of social cohesion and progress. Through this enforcement, public life becomes organized around a metaphysics of universal objectivity, where being properly informed is valued above all else.The antithesis of this is free speech absolutism. Media and education have long glorified individual liberty, often portraying censorship as synonymous with tyranny. The enforcement of free speech absolutism — treating any regulation of speech as dangerous — quietly installs this ideological lesson as a universal framework: that freedom is valued above all else, even at the expense of others' feelings, social cohesion, or truth itself. In this framework, we value our freedom over information integrity, emotional safety, and democratic stability, perpetuating the first-order libertarian ideal without openly stating it.Similarly, anti-hate speech policies reveal how second-order frameworks distribute first-order ideology. Modern pluralistic societies emphasize the protection of marginalized groups, and content celebrating diversity and inclusion is everywhere. The enforcement of ""anti-hate"" regulations carries this deep implication: that emotional harm and subjective feelings deserve institutional protection. Thus, anti-hate enforcement teaches that our feelings should be valued — that emotional safety is not merely a private concern, but a political and communicative standard that reshapes the public sphere.In each case, second-order enforcement distributes first-order ideology by naturalizing its assumptions about legitimacy, safety, harm, and truth. What appears as neutral procedural management — combating misinformation, protecting speech, ensuring emotional safety — is in fact the continuation of elite interests by other means. Thus, mental production is no longer simply about distributing beliefs; it is about embedding frameworks that structure the conditions of belief themselves. Today's ideological domination operates not only on the level of what we think, but even more profoundly on what kind of relationship to truth, harm, and freedom we are allowed to have."

Through various assignments and class discussions, I honed my ability to evaluate arguments, assess evidence, and identify logical fallacies, enabling me to approach complex issues with a more discerning eye. Additionally, I gained a deeper appreciation for the power of effective communication. Whether it was through written assignments and class discussions, I learned how to articulate my ideas clearly and persuasively, tailoring my message to different audiences and contexts. Lastly, this course exposed me to diverse perspectives and challenged my preconceived notions.

I learned about so many new German authors and works and how to analyze and discuss complicated pieces of writing.

I know significantly more about important German Jewish authors and artists and the history than I did before taking this class.

Throughout the semester, I received many opportunities to practice my German through different activities targeting writing, reading, listening, and speaking. By the end of the course, I felt particularly proud of my improved reading skills. I found the texts to be quite challenging, but ultimately led to immense improvements in my German reading comprehension. I also developed a greater understanding of Jewish-German history and culture in the Modernist time period. I had already consumed some of the media (film and literature mainly) that we discussed in this course, but through our in-depth class discussions, I learned to see these and many new materials through alternative perspectives. It was particularly exciting to discuss the context of different works and ponder the potential implications these contexts could have on the overall meaning of literature, film, and art. Finally, this course helped me develop an understanding of and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of people and ideas. Throughout the course, we saw the connections and overlap between the authors, artists, filmmakers, and philosophers located in Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. It truly made me appreciate and ponder the ways in which information is spread. And, how inspiration is spread as well."

Dr. Gellen was so supportive and recognized that some of the works we discussed in this class were very challenging. She was very understanding and helped guide discussions or explain concepts when we were confused. It also helped that Dr. Gellen is clearly very passionate about the subject which made me excited to learn more and ask questions in class. I thought there was a good balance between papers and presentations. Grading was fair. I also really liked how often we finished the entire assigned reading (either because Dr. Gellen chose shorter works or they were spread out over several class periods). I  think I got more out of the short stories/novellas in particular by reading the entire thing rather than just an excerpt from the story.

I came into this course with very minimal knowledge about Modern German-Jewish history, literature, and culture. This course immersed me completely in the thoughts and ideas of a time period that I had never studied before and taught me to look at works of art and literature through a different lens.

Don't be afraid if you are not Jewish, have no history/literature background, etc. because neither did I, and it meant that I was even more impressed with how much I had learned!

2) Close Reading and Film Analysis: I improved my ability to engage in close reading and film analysis, emphasizing how to critically unpack texts and visual narratives in relation to broader social and cultural contexts.
3) Understanding Representations of Violence: I explored how graphic depictions of violence can serve as tools for education and enlightenment, pushing myself to remain open-minded about the purpose and impact of such representations."

However, I learnt that often in academia, one has to bite the bullet and decide what battles to fight. As such I learnt to disengage from arguments that did not give me back fruitful ideas and were unproductive to thinking critically about the issues the artists' work that was the primary material in the course was trying to do. The actual work was often buried in the discussions about the artists themselves and the participants were not asked to refrain from make universal statements about the literary or film-studies based values expressed in the works. I learnt that when the discussion becomes performative, I must quietly save my labor for when I have the intellectual and emotional energy. I enjoyed quite a few of the readings, both primary and secondary, but found that the discussions were often overshadowed by manspreading in the workplace, an issue often unaddressed in the graduate seminar, a workspace often disguised as solely a classroom. Lastly, and on a positive note, I learnt how to identify textual evidence to dialectically decipher the place a given text occupies in the literary history as visible from the contemporary moment."

We started with Descartes, the father of modern philosophy, and moved on from there. Our book, Minds and Computers, concluded with computational theory of mind, which argues that if humans are machines, the brain is basically the hardware and the mind is the software. However, Searle showed us that computationalism can't answer intentionality (formal programs can't constitute understanding), so we have tried to find other theories that may work to explain the mind. Between Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Brentano, Dennet, Hagel, we have come to realize the importance of subjective experience in the world.

It helped the course become less overwhelming with information. The prep sheets are much more helpful when they serve as a conversation with the article rather than what felt like a quiz on them."

He began the classes by asking what we had questions about in the reading, which was an incredibly effective and helpful way to teach as it allowed us to gain understanding about the very difficult papers that would have been hard to understand otherwise. Also, he was a major proponent of no technology in the classroom, which I initially disliked but eventually came to greatly appreciate as it helped me and the other students in the class stay focused and engaged."

We also often brought in personal experiences (as we were discussing a lot of phenomenology), which allowed every person to connect with the topic even if we did not perfectly understand the reading or did not have a particularly deep background on the subject.

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I love the way the course was structured, both the overarching structure of different themes for different groups of stories and the day-to-day structure of reading 1-5 short stories for class, coming to class to discuss in-depth, and then writing a short paper about a handful of these stories later on. I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

I think breaking up classes, or parts of each class, into either lecture or discussion would be more engaging and let the material stick more. I think students would get more out of it that way."

It was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Duke. The readings are both thought-provoking and entertaining, as are the in-class discussions we had about them. By the end of the course, you'll be able to say that you're well-versed in modern European short fiction authors like Kafka, Joyce, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Mann, Sartre, Camus, etc. You get to do some cool out-of-class excursions too, like to the Rare Books library and the Nasher. The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently. I genuinely have no criticisms of this class."
