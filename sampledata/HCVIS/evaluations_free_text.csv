Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I believe the methodology of doing the projects in modules, in which you work on it through 3-4 weeks, is great; it allows us to have time to be more familiar and comfortable with new software/digital tools and to improve the ideas over time. This method was certainly efficient for me, and although the course was fast-paced, I could keep up with the assignments throughout the weeks."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The course's modular structure and lighter submissions, instead of a final project, were effective in terms of quickly engaging with various methodologies and software tools. It was sometimes challenging, especially when I wanted to develop more complex ideas. However, the scope of the submissions was clear and manageable, which kept projects from becoming overly time-consuming or needing finalization. I also appreciated Professor Olson's efforts, such as the detailed and clear written and video instructions he sent every week, which made the assignments and learning process much easier."

This allowed students to gain experience synthesizing information and presenting it to a big group, but there were also some readings or concepts that I feel should have been introduced by the professor, instead (i.e. the major topics or themes that would underscore the entire semester). Class discussions were always engaging and the professor would always jump in if there was something that she needed to say, correct, or introduce, but overall the structure relied a lot on trusting other students to understand the material and relay it to each other."

It was sometimes challenging, especially when I wanted to develop more complex ideas. However, the scope of the submissions was clear and manageable, which kept projects from becoming overly time-consuming or needing finalization. I also appreciated Professor Olson's efforts, such as the detailed and clear written and video instructions he sent every week, which made the assignments and learning process much easier."
