I think it would be helpful for that to be a bit more interactive. For example, if we could have an exercise/assignment that asked us to turn the levels up on one part of a raw audio and then down on another, or asked us to fade different parts in and out. Though we learned how to do all of these things by Professor Biewen showing us in class, I felt like when it came time to edit my first piece I was still re-teaching most of it to myself because the Hindenburg instruction was less hands on."

I learned three distinct things that are valuable as skills as a journalist, as well as skills as a person. Barry really taught me the importance of listening. He did this in several ways. He incorporated voices of other journalists, he incorporated his own experience, and then he challenged us to interview each other. All three of these activities pointed towards the importance of listening actively and what that looks like. Barry also taught us about trauma-informed interviewing. By going over his own mistakes from the past, he demonstrated how easy it is to come across the wrong way to someone who has experienced trauma. The lesson felt real and genuine, and made approaching difficult subjects must easier. Finally, Barry taught me the importance of research. Going into any interaction whether an interview or an expert opinion, knowing the work and experience of the person on the other side is a demonstration of respect. Barry was critical to my passion and love for writing."

The evaluation system allowed for a low-stress environment while also forcing you to do real work and accomplish significant things (like doing a series of intimate interviews with a stranger). I liked the structure of the course as well, with interviews of advocates coming before the narrative, personal interviews. It allowed me to get more comfortable with interviewing by speaking with people who didn't need as much guidance from the interviewer (me!)."

I worked on bringing in a human voice to the stories I tell, aiming to strike a better balance between explaining the histories and complexities of real-world issues and sharing the personal experiences of people connected to those issues.

I thought the workload was perfectly suited to the course, with enough required engagement with material to ensure that we were growing as readers and writers, but not so much that we were overwhelmed with the number of assignments before us. I enjoyed having one piece to work with each week that we could really dive into, and I liked having the response papers as a vehicle that prompted deeper reflection -- but not required every week to allow for some flexibility when our outside schedules got more intense. Same goes for the schedule of assignments related to the final paper -- I liked having smaller check-in excerpts due throughout the semester to keep us accountable to the reporting process, but appreciated being able to schedule interviews/reporting/writing on a timeline that worked for us up until the full draft was due near the end of the semester."

Keeping up with current events is something that I value, so being able to do so through assignments, lectures, and class discussions was highly enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to make the powerpoints more engaging or perhaps limiting them altogether. Although I understand the informational value they bring, they can also not be particularly intellectually stimulating when taking up the entire class period."

I don't think this is the fault of the professor but more the class makeup -- it was dominated by students with the same ideologies getting their news from large papers that skewed left of center. Maybe in order to combat this, more of the readings could be from conservative outlets or perhaps ""extra credit"" of not only keeping up with Reliable Sources/The Morning but also regularly consuming news from right-leaning papers. Not sure how feasible that is but an idea."

I think with a foundation in either, Professor Buckley can foster a love for both. Don't expect the class to be a breeze just because it has sports in the name, though. To get the grade you want, this course will require full engagement in the assignments and class discussions."
