For example, I knew there were indigenous people in Mexico, but I had never thought to question how their status of indigeneity could change. Similarly, I never knew that the Mexicans who chose to stay in the U.S had to denounce their status as Indigenous individuals as it did not correlate with the U.S. definition of indigenous"

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The small seminar class has helped facilitate various conversations that reflected some of the feelings of the students in the class. Majority of us have some sort of tie to Latin America and being able to talk about and relate to common experiences we have faced has been very validating. I also loved having the service aspect of the class. Getting out of the ""Duke bubble"" to engage with the Latinx Durham community was fulfilling and helped me create ties to a new community."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In the course, I developed critical thinking skills when examining labels and concepts like Latino and Latinidad. I learned about the history of the Latinx community in the United States and gained insight into issues like discrimination and assimilation that followed mass migration. I learned about the relevance of music in Latinx culture and thought about the many ways it can be used to express and explore culture."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",I liked how the professor and TA were able to adapt to obstacles that came up throughout the semester. The first few weeks the classroom was set up in a U-shape but they saw that within the large group students were not engaging as much so they split us up into groups of 3 or 4. This took away some of the pressure and helped start more stimulating conversations within our small groups but also within the larger class setting.

I was always engaged in the material, mostly because she presented it well. Her fun personality made every class enjoyable, and her kindness made asking questions very easy. Since she was a great teacher, students were able to feel comfortable in class, and a great classroom culture/community was born. I would keep all methods of instruction, especially the slides used every class (the warm-ups helped me review concepts, and I loved how new information was presented)."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","After 5 semesters at Duke, Profe Carson is easily one of the best teacher's I've had. Her genuine enthusiasm, passion for the subject, love for her students, and excitement to see us grow was my primary motivation for this semester. I genuinely wish she could keep teaching me Spanish throughout my time at Duke. You can clearly tell that she loves what she does and she's also excellent at teaching- she's clear, warm, and great at providing feedback in a constructive way.Critically, she taught us new grammar in English, and this is EASILY the most helpful thing she's done. It's impossible to learn a new topic while simultaneously trying to translate in your head, so it was super helpful.The structure of the class- warm-up, low-stakes activities, and lots of opportunity to practice- made the language feel less like a memorization exercise and something I looked forward to every morning.The ability to collaborate with my peers, the different kinds of activities we did-but most importantly, Profe Carson herself- made me a more efficient learner than I've been in years."

She made the classroom environment so much fun and very relaxed. I love that there was always no pressure and it made if so much easier to learn without being afraid of messing up. The structure of the course is very simple and clean and i think that makes it much easier to learn and retain information. I am a big fan of the review activities we do at the beginning of every class. I like that the class wasn't like a lecture. When we had things we needed to learn, for example grammar bursts, Profe Carson didn't sit there and lecture us for more than 5-10 min. It was always so conversational and hands-on learning which really benefited me and accommodated to my language learning style."

I like the way she outlines the class and gets so much done without rushing you. I really like the boomerangs, and the torea orals helped me study effectively and helped some of the content stick better. I liked how she was open to taking questions and responded kindly. Positive reinforcement is an essential aspect of learning especially something that is brand new and without it I would have just given up and been too overwhelmed."

This said, I did not like the Blink Platform, interactive textbooks, or quizzes (which I understand Professor Fernandez has no control over).

Similarly, the quizzes were always overly specific, and I don't think they provide accurate measures of our engagement or understanding of the course material.

Sometimes it can be awkward because you have no idea what she's saying. You'll be participating a lot and it's a big part of your grade. Lots of group projects."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

For example, on the few days Harry was absent, we attended sessions led by a different professor, and those classes felt much more relaxed and better aligned with my personal goals for improving Spanish, but also just finishing my grad requirement.As someone taking their final Spanish course at Duke, I would have preferred a more balanced class focused on benchmarks and steady progress, like I experienced in 203. That said, this course is a great fit for students starting Spanish at a higher level and planning to continue into 300-level courses. Harry constantly pushes you to exceed expectations and evaluates accordingly—especially when it comes to writing assignments."

I felt extremely well prepared for every quiz and Harry made sure we knew where to look for extra support/resources if we ever needed nay help preparing for quizzes or other assignments. Although Harry can be a bit sarcastic or sassy at times, he is one of only a few professors who goes above and beyond in ensuring that his students are set up for success as best as possible…and you can tell that he genuinely cares about the well being of his students both within Spanish 204 and beyond.

Especially considering I have taken Spanish for 8 years now, I think this course has not only pushed me the hardest, but also truly made me start to gain a true understanding of the language. My biggest takeaway, and I think the difference between this course and all my previous courses, was the idea of thinking in Spanish rather than thinking in English and translating to Spanish. What I have noticed over that past semester is that through being in this course, this skill of thinking in Spanish has started to come naturally to me. Not only have I significantly improved my in-class writings, but I have also become more fluent when I speak. When I speak in English, which I am fluent in, I do not think about what I say but rather that it just naturally comes out. With Spanish, I think what was preventing me from obtaining this next step in my journey was a lack of Spanish thinking."

Moreover, it was heavily emphasized the different levels of how we choose which conjugation is needed rather than simply generalizing rules. We always discussed why a particular sentence is worded the way it is and what rules apply to it. Lastly, I realized the importance of having confidence to answer up in class and taking in criticism if and when something you said was wrong. Although it was scary at first, I began to realize the benefits of having your speaking skills critiqued on the spot, as it provides immediate and useful feedback that you would not otherwise get."

I also noticed myself greatly improving in my writing skills because we completed ""escrituras"" at the end of class every Friday, which are 15-minute writing sessions about a topic we covered in class, and this led me to improve in my ability to write fluidly, similarly to how I had to learn to speak publicly, without having time to translate everything in my head or access to any resources to translate words I didn't know.

By providing ways for us to collaborate with our piers, we were able to get to know each other. Whenever we had questions, we had no fears in asking others. When attending an academic institution like Duke, there can be large fears of competition between classmates. This classroom was the exact opposite, characterized by collaboration. In moving forward, group course components such as the ""Mesa Redonda"" and ""Proyectos en Grupo"" are essential to keep."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Karahalios was great at explaining complicated concepts and functions in a very simple and clear manner, while still making sure he used almost exclusively Spanish while teaching. This was very helpful to me, because it allowed me to gradually come to understand more and more of the things I wouldn't have been able to absorb before this course and learn how to improvise when I was called on and didn't have the vocabulary I needed or know how to convey a point in Spanish the same way I would convey it in English. My favorite course components were our group projects, which we had to prepare with small groups in one day of class and then present to the rest of the class, and the Mesa Redonda project, which was a bigger assignment in which groups of around 4 had about a week to prepare an hour-long presentation of topics and discussion of articles and sources that are sent to the class to study before the discussion. These projects made me much better at verbalizing complex ideas in Spanish on the fly and understanding more complicated ideas that others were trying to get across."

This helped my learning because I always had to be paying attention and by contributing to group conversation I learned more Spanish. For future years I think that group projects and mesa redondas should be kept because presenting in front of the class without writing down everything I was going to say helped me become a better Spanish speaker. Additionally, I enjoyed when my professor used Kahoots which I think should be kept for next semester because they helped me discover what I needed to spend more time studying."

Another aspect of the class that was intellectually stimulating was centering our learning around cultural themes.

For example, throughout the semester, we had to write summaries of news articles. At the start of the course, it took me several hours to write a 2-3 paragraph summary of a short news article, as it had been a couple years since my last Spanish course (junior year of high school.) However, throughout this course, I built greater fluency with reading and writing, and can now summarize an article in the same amount of time as I could in English.(2) Additionally, I learned about writing conventions in Spanish. I'd always been curious about things like how punctuation and other grammar conventions in Spanish work, i.e. whether or not they are the same as in English or not. In this course, I learned how to introduce quotes when writing in Spanish, use commas when writing lists, alongside other conventions; some of these were the same as in English, and others were different.(3) Finally, I've further hones my research skills in Spanish through our final project, a research paper requiring me to read, analyze, and contextualize several sources and build an argument based on these."

The grammar was a complicated way about learning about previously simple rules, but this was good because we went more in depth for things that are typically overlooked (like a lot of rules regarding subjunctive that I had never learned before). We also got better at writing in Spanish, through a large number of writing assignments. Especially at the beginning of the year, we would do almost a writing assignment due per class, of about 300 words or so, which taught me the ability to plan my thoughts and execute what I was going to say in Spanish, composing the piece in a matter of a couple hours. I also learned the importance of communication, since we had two thirty minute conversations in Spanish with an adult living in a Latin American country, which helped improve my speaking skills but also helped me realize that speaking is the most important form of foreign language communication and the thing I need the most work on."

Often times, we would briefly be instructed on a topic in the group, then move to smaller groups, then return to the larger class to share our small group discussions. In a foreign language class, having this opportunity to think through our responses and workshop our ideas into something that we felt comfortable sharing aloud was overwhelmingly valuable. Moreso, in a class that by nature discusses sensitive topics, I think the time in small groups helped us to feel more comfortable with one another when sharing vulnerable ideas, especially in an online environment where connection might otherwise not be so easy. I would genuinely say that I have made friends in this class that I look forward to seeing when I return to campus, and that is something that I would not say from many classes at Duke in general, especially not an online class and one taught primarily in a foreign language. Additionally, the instructor was extremely accessible, checking in with us weekly and encouraging us to schedule brief meetings with him to ensure that we were feeling prepared for success in the class.

It is evident that he is incredibly passionate about what he teaches and also very knowledgeable about the subject. Throughout the semester, we only scratch the surface of all of the readings and interesting topics that he has knowledge of, but he condenses everything in a way that is thought-provoking and interesting. I liked how organized Profe was, and how structured he made the course, with discussion guides before class to help us digest readings, shorter blog assignments to help us practice writing and speaking Spanish, and longer essays to synthesize different texts we read. He made PowerPoint for each class with key concepts from readings, questions to consider, and applications to previous readings, which really helped me understand class material. Profe took the time to learn about Canvas before the start of the semester and had folders with all of the class readings, assignment discussions, and every possible resource you could need as a student learning Spanish. He genuinely wanted us to succeed, improving both as Spanish speakers and as people. He was also always willing to answer questions after class and provide feedback on how we were doing."

Sometimes the energy was low and we didn't have much to say, but Profe would always call on us and make us step out of our comfort zone which is something that I think was very beneficial for us to make us engage in the class. The course was structured where we did a lot of things outside of the class and then we came to class to talk about them. I think this structure was nice sometimes, but sometimes it felt repetitive for us to just keep talking about the same thing that we had already learned about on our own, so maybe incorporating some additional videos or readings that we do in class instead of talking about the same ones that we already wrote an essay or discussion post about would be better."

Then, we would gather as a whole class to discuss what we talked about in our small groups. This helped me gain confidence in speaking Spanish in front of other people. It also helped me become more comfortable in speaking in Spanish."

This course has taught me to look at everyday experiences and cultural products more thoughtfully and the implications they may have. This might have been one of the only courses this semester where I felt comfortable engaging in class discussions and I think it is because the professor is great at getting us out of our shells and truly connecting with the material itself.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","One insight I gained during the class was the cultural impact of being Latino on different systems here in the United States. A good example of this is the fact that many Latino people do not question authority because they think a doctor knows better than them, leading to potential misdiagnoses. Because I am considering a job in the healthcare field, this insight is something I can help change (i.e. encouraging Latinx patients to speak up about their experiences). Similarly, I also learned how to better engage a class in a group discussion. For instance, the Mesa Redonda taught me the importance of using a thought provoking question (i.e. why a white person cast in a Latinx role is considered progressive, but not vice versa). Finally, I also learned how to better engage with the community. I was quite shy and stayed in my Duke bubble before this course, afraid to do things such as reach out to local restaurant owners. Being obligated to do so in this class exposed me to a wide variety of pillars of the Durham community, such as Boricua, which helps maintain a safe space for Black/Latinx people in Durham and support the most vulnerable (i.e. those in subsidized housing)."

Similarly, I also think that the class discussions done related to the content generally went quite well. I enjoyed the fact that we would first discuss our ideas in small groups before moving into a larger group discussion, allowing us to collect our ideas or the main takeaways we had from the video before beginning to discuss to a larger group. I also liked that the course had service learning, as it helped us apply what we learned in class to a broader context (e.g. applying the knowledge we have of Latino children in American schools and their disadvantages coming from another family to the learning delays we may see from them in class)."

The class involved a lot of reading and writing, so I had to become familiar with how to manage my time between weekly readings and the writing assignments that we had to write.As it would turn out, my first college ""paper"" was actually in this Spanish class, so it wasn't even in my primary language. Writing this 1,000 word Spanish paper really helped me develop both writing and phrasing skills that I have been able to apply to all my other assignments, and has advanced my style of writing greatly.Finally, the class taught me the importance of participation. Professor Mulligan made it clear that being present mindfully in class was crucial to understanding the themes and work-load that we had to handle. Speaking up and asking questions was the best way to engage, and listening to your peers when they had interventions was the most efficient way of relating to them and maybe realize some aspects of the material you wouldn't have realized initially."

For future years, I would continue the parts of class where we work in groups to try and analyze texts and share our findings, as it helped me synthesize what we read.

For instance, when I would read a part of a text that confused me (which was often, given if it was in a second language), I would spend time thinking about why the author might have made the choice they did. A good example is the comic ""La pesadilla de Obi"" - I spent a lot of time reflecting on why the author choosed to have overarching plot devices such as Obi's testicular cancer, and include elements such as Obi exploring both heaven and hell. I also think this class was intellectually stimulating when it came time to write essays. For example, I read a lot of fascinating articles on how Ana Maria Matute constantly reflected on loss of childhood innocence while writing my essay for ""Pecado de omisión""."

Professor Rosa always seems to have the perfect source or piece of supplementary material to enhance and deepen our class discussion, and fuel stimulating dialogue.  One of my favorite things about Professor Rosa that characterizes his class environment is his ability to continuously stoke the fire of any class discussion.

I also learned how to analyze primary sources and extract important details from them while relating them to the context of the history that was occurring at the time.

There are striking similarities.

It is a great class and it will enhance many skills to anyone taking it! Your Spanish speaking will be challenged and enhanced, and you will explore Latin American history and politics in a way most people probably have not had before."

I'm a native speaker and it still takes me a long time - you can't get away with just skimming through them. If you actually want to be able to participate you'll have to spend a lot of time on the readings. However, prof. Mulligan is genuinely one of the sweetest and most understanding people and is always super willing to give extensions or provide additional help if you need it. He always offers to meet outside of class in order to help you better understand assignments or just talk more. He provides a lot of support which makes it much easier."

It might be challenging at first, especially if Spanish is not your first language or if you struggle with it. However, if you are interested in the content of the class, you will be fine as long as you work hard!"
SPANISH-390S-01_Mulligan__Joseph_Fall_2023.html,Fall 2023,SPANISH-390S-01 : TOPICS IN SPANISH STUDIES.SPANISH-390S-01.,Joseph Mulligan,7,What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future?,"I would say that the professor is very engaging and demonstrates clear enthusiasm for the Course when he is not tired. Not his issue, although it was a bit concerning on my part to see a professor clearly tired sometimes. It was only a visual thing not a behavior thing as he still went through class in an educative manner. The life of a humanities professor is not so easy. Aside from the professor, the content is very informative and engaging although if you're unfamiliar with politics it takes a lot of searches to find the foundations of some of the topics mentioned. For example, prior to my college life, I used to be an ignorant individual who wished no relations to politics and have had no interest in history for the most part. However, if you put the effort in and break down the complexity of the readings, you will learn a lot. For the readings, if you find them too difficult, I would recommend reading it once in Spanish and then translating the denser parts to English, read that, and then go back to re read the page. This was very helpful to me since some of the terminology was too complex at times for me too fully understand the undertones of the text rather than the general messages--a nuance you have to consider a lot when dealing with politics. I would also promote speaking when you get the chance and have no fear of making mistakes. Often, when some of the native speakers talk it seems as if they have a vast understanding of the topic but they are stating their answers in a simple manner but their fluency makes it seem more than it is. (not that they weren't, it just exudes this air of being more knowledgeable when really, what they say is quite simple and not so complex)."

Professor Mulligan does a great job of creating an environment where everyone's voice can be heard, so don't hesitate to speak up when you have any insight to share. However, I would also encourage you to practice deep and engaged listening (not just listening to formulate a response) when your classmates are talking. Professor Mulligan will propose thought-provoking questions and guide insightful conversations and I encourage you to listen to all there is to be learned from your classmates sharing their personal lived experiences as they relate to the course."

The only real ""guidelines"" for the papers were in the syllabus, and that was just to tell you how long the paper should be. Papers are ""open to interpretation"", but it can be hard to know what exactly he wants. It would also help to just speak to him directly, as he is really a very kind professor. The big papers can just be a little daunting when you're not sure what to write about. Other than that though, great course, I would reccomend."
