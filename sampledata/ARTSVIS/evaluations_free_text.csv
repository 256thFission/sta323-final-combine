Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

I think setting times for critique durations helped me zone out less at times when no one was saying anything during the critiques. I actually liked when Hareth assigned each of us to lead another classmate's critique because it allowed us to hear from other students and also used a decent amount of time.

You will be rewarded for putting in a good effort, and your photos will turn out great. Listen to Hareth's feedback and apply it each week to strengthen your photos. Be creative, as well.

Unlike core subject classes, you'll have to put 100% effort into each assignment, and you'll have to go places and coordinate photoshoots with people.

However, my positive experiences with these aforementioned things have motivated me to go to more events around campus and Durham. I think this is most notable with the performances in Page Auditorium. I will also say this course has helped me network/ reach out when working with my community partner.

While the course didn't specifically emphasize the quality and completeness of concepts, I dedicated time to enhance my ability in this area.
Lastly, I cultivated the skill of critiquing my peers' work. I gained insights into their thought processes and the journey leading to their final products.

I think that it is a good mix of the theory and applications of lighting design in theater. The class is not too much work, but provides you with opportunities to do a lot of extra experimentation on the projects if you are really interested in lighting design."

However, since light design does not require any specific skills, it is open to students with all levels and backgrounds. It is at a balance of artistic training and technical training, exposing students to both theatrical design and technology. The course functions well as an introduction into theatrical technology in general with lots of hand-on opportunities."

I'm amazed by how Professor Jenny Lion was able to take seemingly widespread concepts and dig deeply into what they meant to our society, so much so that we were able to produce creative video art through examining the contexts of everything we discussed within the course. In Video Art and Politics, I developed a deeper understanding of how moving images can function as both aesthetic expression and political intervention. The course expanded my critical lens as a media maker and viewer. Three specific things I learned are:- The Power of Visual Rhetoric – I gained insight into how visual language, framing, and editing choices can shape political meaning and influence audiences emotionally and intellectually. This helped me reflect more intentionally on my own creative decisions and the messages they convey.- Expanded Definitions of Activism and Art – I learned how artists and filmmakers use nontraditional forms, such as video installations, essay films, and acts of tactical media, as political tools. These works challenged me to rethink the boundaries of what counts as political art and to appreciate the role of experimentation in social critique.- Process as Political Practice – Through the final project and class discussions, I understood how the process of making video art (including collaboration, research, and engagement with communities) can itself be a political act. This insight will continue to shape how I approach media production and storytelling in socially engaged contexts."

Also, Jenny co-ordinated artists to come speak to our class like Wendy Clarke who did The Love Tapes.

One of the most impactful components was the balance between theory and practice—readings and screenings provided historical and conceptual context, while creative assignments allowed us to respond artistically. This dual approach helped me internalize complex ideas through hands-on application. I also appreciated the peer feedback sessions and in-class critiques, which created a collaborative and supportive environment. Hearing from others enriched my perspective and gave me practical suggestions to refine my work.For future years, I’d definitely keep the final project format that allowed us to define our own intervention and work across mediums.

In creating my short film, I really had to organize my time effectively and motivate myself to keep on track, and I felt like this course helped us structure the development of this skill well. I also learned a lot about the process of production and all the little administrative tasks that go into making a film. Finally, I got better at presenting unfinished works in front of people. Normally, in the past, I would only ever show finished works. However, to receive valuable feedback, I have realized that showing progress to people along the way is really important."

Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

The integration of critical theory with hands-on design work created a unique space to experiment and question—something I haven’t experienced in other courses. The encouragement to situate our own identities and research within our mapping projects made the work personally meaningful and conceptually rich.What made the course especially engaging was the freedom to pursue a self-directed final project. It pushed me to synthesize spatial analysis, historical research, and visual storytelling in new ways. I was able to explore how cartography can represent liminal spaces and historical erasure—central themes in my dissertation."

Susie wants to develop relationships with students and guide them along the process so although sometimes film can be overwhelming, she made it comforting and enjoyable."

This made it easy to figure out what readings/videos needed to be done before the class started the next year. I also liked the flipped classroom, as many thoughtful discussions and insights came from the professor allowing us to talk about the subject matter in class. I also loved the trip to the Nasher as it was another way to explore the themes and goals of the course reflected by an everyday example. I also liked that the papers were open-ended and allowed for the writer to reflect on their own experiences and pick the works we examined in class that most resonated with them. I would keep all of these elements for future years."

They were more dynamic and allowed us to incorporate a lot of skills we personally had. It gave us an organization or community to reach out to, which helped. I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy."" I think the final paper was kind of shoved in there at the end, but I much prefer that over any final exam."

In terms of costumes, I learned of the new frontiers of costume technology, such as fiber optic lights and thermochromic material, and how they are applied to theater.

The course also provided ample opportunities to refine my concept development skills. I learned to take my understanding of a text and expand it into a comprehensive concept. While the course didn't specifically emphasize the quality and completeness of concepts, I dedicated time to enhance my ability in this area.
Lastly, I cultivated the skill of critiquing my peers' work. I gained insights into their thought processes and the journey leading to their final products.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","There was a great blend of theory and practice. I would keep the in-class lab time and I would keep the projects where we make a lighting design for a mood, a phrase, and some songs. Those projects were all really fun and informative."

The topics, such as to express a certain emotion with one light design, are interesting and inspiring since it requires me to reflect on my emotional experience and to express it in a way that is understandable by others. However, the assignments are less open to students with a different perspective and aesthetic language than the majority of the student body since the assignments are graded based on how well it is perceived in the most general and common perspective."

However, since light design does not require any specific skills, it is open to students with all levels and backgrounds. It is at a balance of artistic training and technical training, exposing students to both theatrical design and technology. The course functions well as an introduction into theatrical technology in general with lots of hand-on opportunities."
