After completing the thorough readings and lectures that cleanly organized the materials, the discussions were based on going several steps forward. Professor Daly did an excellent job goading the students to think outside the box, to cumulate the knowledge learned from readings and lectures to ruminate on inferences and implications. Many times the students including myself had a difficult time answering his questions, and after a fair bit of time, the professor gave us hints and reference points to help us get to answering with our opinions. Though there were obviously wrong answers, we were not admonished for them, but were rather encouraged to be opinionated and free thinking. He wasn't controversial or biased when answering questions, and always gave us multiple facets of a given situation. This approach created a classroom dynamic of thinking beyond."

The continent was contextualized, in terms of the Atlantic Slave Trade and the lasting damage that EuroAmerica did to the continent and its people. But the course wasn't just a narrative of African pain. We also talked about the innovation and advancement that also exists on the continent. We talked about MPesa, the longing for travel and the Diversity Visa Program, the reciprocal process of identity creation and authenticity occurring between continental Africans and people in the diaspora, etc. It was very insightful"

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

The first few weeks the classroom was set up in a U-shape but they saw that within the large group students were not engaging as much so they split us up into groups of 3 or 4. This took away some of the pressure and helped start more stimulating conversations within our small groups but also within the larger class setting.

We had minimal homework, but i think i learned the most in this class out of any of the classes i took this semester, because Dr. B is an amazing teacher and truly wants you to learn. Additionally, she roots for you and wants you to succeed and wants you to learn without the fear of getting a bad grade, so it's really impossible to get a bad grade with her. I learned so so much about health and medicine and global health, and this course has truly changed me. Seriously. I learned so many new things, and it was so, so, so interesting. In fact, out of any class i took (college and high school), I think this is my favorite class and i learned so so much. i can't emphasize just how much i learned in a very low-stress environment. This course was truly eye-opening."

I thought this was important because race is so misunderstood specifically in healthcare and it ties in well with the rest of the class. I really appreciated having guest speakers and the other lessons like Henrietta Lacks, ways to counteract the negative epigenetic changes, ACEs, maternal health, etc… All of these helped grow my understanding of the concepts as they connected everything to real-life examples and scenarios.

This shifted my perspective: money isn’t just about economics; it’s about people’s beliefs and social ties.
Finally, I explored money’s role in power structures. From colonial histories to modern cryptocurrencies, I saw how monetary systems enforce or challenge inequality. This course taught me to question assumptions—like the myth of barter, and analyze money as a tool of social control. Now, I see every transaction as part of a larger cultural story."

I enjoy a lecture-style class, and it was a bit of an adjustment but I ended up enjoying the no-slides style of the class and how the professor just talks and we listen and take notes. I like how Dr. Piot is very open to hearing from students in the class regarding our readings and also to provide their knowledge on some o the topics we were discussing. As someone who is less familiar with econ and anthropology, this allowed for me to be able to sit back and listen and learn which I really appreciated. I enjoyed the course components as well - although the readings could be dense and sometimes difficult to parse out, the fact that we would go through them in class and highlight the important information was very helpful. The 2 papers were also great, with clear instructions, and could be easily completed with the information we learned in class. The two exams were as expected (well the first at least, we haven't taken the second yet) and not anything too surprising."

I found it to be super interesting and it made me think about money in ways that I never had before. The workload was very light. Each week there would be assigned readings. You don't even have to read them because Professor Piot dives deep enough into them during class which I appreciated. Our grade was made up of 2 essays and 2 exams. The essay topics were very fun to write about. I would recommend going to office hours before writing them. The TAs are extremely helpful and you can ask them literally anything. They also tell you exactly what they are looking for in the essay. The exams were good too. The way to do well on them is to go to every class (though attendance isn't required) and just write down everything that is said. If you understand your notes and read them before the test, you will do well. The test consisted of true/false questions to start and then a bunch of short answer questions. A lot of people didn't do well on the true/false section so they ended up curving that part. Overall, the course was really cool and you learn a lot about money, even though you would think you know everything about it given how common it is."

This is something I haven't seen any other professor do before, and as someone who has a few reservations about the nature of literature and the academy, something I didn't take for granted.

Professor Lubiano is very intelligent but often struggles with conveying information, so her lectures are quite disjointed and convoluted. Many times, she would leave no room for students to speak during the entire 2.5-hour class. There was a lot of assigned reading, but, as stated, we rarely discussed them and were instead lectured at about them for 2.5 hours. And, as the lectures were so hard to follow anyway, it felt like doing the readings was pointless. If you’re looking to learn something about literature, look elsewhere. There are many other excellent professors in the English department with significantly more engaging methods of instruction."

Tim Tyson was arrogant, condescending, and the exact opposite of what I would expect to see in a member of Duke Faculty. To start, he went on an anti semetic rant in class where he said ""no one talks about jew power, but they quietly have power through the banking industry"". While I am not jewish, to see this behavior from a member of such a prestigious university was disgusting. One of my friends in the class is Jewish, and the fact that he had to sit and listen to professor Tysons' ridiculous comments were insane. I also feel very afraid to take action regarding these comments, because Tyson has been extremely vindictive throughout the semester. For example, the majority of the class got an extremely poor grade on the midterm. Instead of trying to help students improve, he said ""if I had taken the test I would have gotten a 100"". I was one of the fortunate few students who got a B (most got a C, D, or F) however he still refused to respond to an email I sent asking him for help in the class. I hope that there is some training given to Tyson in the future to fix his anti semetic and belittling behavior."

On the first day of class Tyson stated that we would have hard conversations that would help us grow. Not a single real conversation about racial relations in the south happened in this class. Instead, each week Tyson would get up there and ramble for the first 90 minutes of class. He is one of the least engaging speakers I have ever listened to. The only reprieve the class would have from Tysons rambling was when professor Williams would get up and sing. Her singing was amazing and was the only positive of each class. When it comes to the readings, Tyson assigned multiple expensive books that he wrote himself. I know that this is common for most professors, however it was extremely frustrating because the books were no different than what he discussed in class. Additionally his two most popular books have been discredited with his Emmitt Till Book being described in one news article as ""Tysons Tall Tales"". I have no problem paying for a book that will enhance my learning. However, when the book is filled with lies made up by a professor who does not care about his students I have a problem purchasing them."

Yes the subject matter was important and strong but the teaching was terrible. Never engaged us. On exam, they did not tell us how they would grade and gave us very broad instructions and then failed most of us because they said we didn't read but they never said it was a reading quiz. Just an exam and given 15 terms so everyone studied by looking them up and he graded so harshly. The other lady who lectured did not make much sense at all and would read from typed out transcript never from her own thoughts."

Professor Tyson made this clear when he fell asleep on three occasions during the semester when he put on a movie. If you want students to engage with the class, it would be nice if the professor was at least awake. When he woke up, he proceeded to make passive aggressive comments about students in the class not paying attention. He was particularly passive aggressive to athletes in the class and he seemed to have a clear bias against student athletes. This is especially true for the basketball players whom he constantly belittled. Each class felt like a game Russian Roulette, where the outcomes would either be Tyson falling asleep, bullying students, or making problematic comments. It is truly hard to put into words how truly awful this class is."

While these lived experiences are valuable, the lectures do not delve deeper into the subject matter or provide additional information to enhance understanding. Instead, the professors tend to repeat the same stories and narratives, which does not facilitate further learning or comprehension of the material. The note cards allow students to formulate their own thoughts and make connections to the readings, but during class, the discussions are heavily focused on the professors' perspectives, leaving little room for students to share their insights or explore their connections to the topics."

Initially, a take-home midterm was listed in the syllabus, but about a week before the midterm, it was abruptly changed to an in-class midterm without proper notice or consent from the students. By the time grades were returned for that midterm, the deadline to take the class on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis or withdraw had already passed. Additional assignments were introduced after this deadline, and the final exam was no longer the sole examination, contrary to what was stated in the syllabus. The grading is stringent, with all assessments being written responses, and any deviation from the professor's expected answers can result in low or even zero scores, immediately impacting overall grades. Throughout the course, students do not have access to a visible grade book or platform like Canvas, making it challenging to track their progress as the syllabus and assignments continue to change unexpectedly. To perform well, memorizing terms from the assigned readings is essential, as outside information is often dismissed, and only definitions from the specified texts are accepted for full credit."

Throughout the semester, we learned about the different laws, social norms, and cultural movements that contributed to the development and continuation of racism. Most importantly, the class discussed the effects of said racism, and explored how they've continued to ensure white supremacy in modernity. Another important factor covered was the concept of color-blind racism, which fundamentally argues that today's racism is maintained through subtle means that appear to uphold equality."

This probably isn't the class you want to take if you are simply looking for an easy class, but it is worthwhile if you find the content to be interesting. Great class!"

I really loved the discussion based nature of the course, and all of the work that you do builds throughout the semester, such that I never felt that I was doing any unnecessary work."

It was such a great way to learn about intersectionality and representation through a feminist lens, and the ways this has been seen historically and today through different mediums. This class led to such thoughtful and interesting discussions, and was one of my favorites I took this semester. It was a fun way to intersect my interests in visual arts with a subject I had not formally delved into at Duke, GSF. The class does not require a lot of work but is rewarding to be a part of nonetheless, and the readings and pieces we examine are so interesting!"

Additionally, the professor's lectures tended to go onto tangents about completely unrelated topics and overgeneralized the Black experience. I remember the professor once asking the class, ""Who runs the Black household?"" Ignoring the fact that the class was majority non-Black, the professor assumed everyone would emphatically answer ""women,"" but that assumes so much. What if your students don't have mothers? What if your students are from a multiracial household? There were so many moments when the professor made gendered generalizations of the Black experience, which always seemed to just be grounded in his own experience. These generalizations of women were often meant to be positive, but the professor's support of women almost always felt patronizing. And, when given the opportunity to really interrogate the gender parity and its psychosocial impact on Black women, there was nothing to be said."

If you keep up with the course readings and you like to engage in a lot of group discussions, then I do believe that this course could be intellectually stimulating for you, however once you get behind, it is difficult to catch up. There are really only two assignments of the midterm and the final project. However be careful which project you pick because one definitely requires more personal investment than the other. Professor Shaharazard is a wonderful person and definitely brings some enthusiasm to class as she is very passionate about the topics in this course.

The readings were thought-provoking and often sparked meaningful discussions that helped connect theory to real-world examples.

As someone who thinks it is hard to go to class, I think there was a massive incentive because there aren't as many grades and most of the knowledge and main points on the exams or essays are discussed in class. I also like when you told personal stories with the Duke Engage trips or your own experiences in Togo because it gave you a lot of credibility."

For example, it is not just enlightenment thought and bad monarchs that caused these revolutions (what is taught in most courses). there are so many more reasons and complexities which we covered in this course."

I like how we didn't accept the readings at face value but could poke holes in them and see the differences between authors in one given week or over the course of the semester. We were given examples of poor ways to write and talk about Africa and public health and that shaped my understanding.I think at the end of the semester it was a little less rigorous/more repetitive with child soldiers and demographics and I would have liked to fit in another topic.

Through taking Dr. Smith's course, I've learned about how war manifests and can change both the political and social landscape of a country. I've learned how to identify motivations for war and what characteristics allow it to exploit a country's most vulnerable populations. Furthermore, discussing topics such as rape as a weapon of war and the HIV/Aids outbreak across Africa has taught me about the importance of diction in how these issues are discussed and reported in the media. Overall, I've learned how to analyze the complexities of health and warfare in Africa outside of the narrow perspective that the media often portrays of the continent."

(For example, I honestly had NO idea that black women slaves were the unwilling subjects who gave us the practice of gynecology we have today.) I also learned how to digest large readings and get the main takeaways as we discussed them during class. As a cis white woman, I do want to mention how I came into this class not having a ton of background on these subjects and I now have learned so much that I will apply in the medical field - like taking into account the history of practices, understanding how livelihoods and backgrounds should be considered, and understanding how my own biases could impact my work on any individual."

It hardly ever met, there were no opportunities to test our knowledge, and there were no assignments besides the final. The professor didn't use slides or organize his lectures beyond a basic chronology from the beginning of hip-hop to the present day. Because the professor cancelled so many classes, we never made it close to the present day and finished in the 1990s. There are podcasts about hip-hop that have to be better than this.

The reading in this class has been about a book a week. When I first began learning with Prof. Shapiro, I would spend hours and hours on reading and it was difficult to have balance. As I matured in the class, I learned how to read a book within two hours, write reflections in response, and have a critical conversation with my classmates about it. This is a skill I really value. Thank you.I learned a lot about contemporary South Africa. I examined and thought about various themes such as employment, what democracy means, popular engagement, etc. It's required me to think critically about a society I haven't existed within, which was an interesting experience.I also learned how to build a curriculum. In our ""What's Missing"" paper, Prof. Shapiro asked us to add a theme to our coursework. This made me think about what sources and discussion questions would make for an enlightening and interesting class. I thought that becoming the professor, in a way, was cool."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I wo;uld like to say my focus was primarily on themes of humanism, identity, and racial capital. Each of these themes are directly connected to one another and approach the idea of the black radical tradition in various ways. For humanism, we spent the course reading Fanon, Robinson, Wilderson and other black intellectual thinkers who are redefining what it means to be and exist outside the concept of being human. This directly leads to our understanding of how this would affect idenity, as if one is not even considered to be human or considered to be lesser than human, their would be a sort of inferiority complex or psychological notion of subjugation that would become instilled in a community. Thus, the ideas surrounding racial capital come into the foray, for in order to further advance the rather insatiable hunger of capitalism and its systems, a form of racial order or hierarchy only benefits profit and labor. This course helped me in connecting some of these ideas effectively and providing thoughtful analysis when bringing together these subjects."

Creative Engagement with Archival Material: Through our exposure to artists, writers, and scholars who use the archive as both material and metaphor, I developed new ways of thinking about memory, storytelling, and resistance. The course showed me how archives can be reimagined through poetry, performance, and visual art.
Diasporic and Transnational Thinking: I learned to think across geographies and histories—connecting the Black experience in the U.S., South Africa, and other parts of the diaspora. The course challenged me to think about the global entanglements of anti-Blackness and creative survival."

Specifically in terms of the Black archive, I  have the following takeaways from the course1) Theoretical frameworks for archiving: In this course I  learned about the theoretical frameworks about the different forms of archiving. With each of the readings, I was introduced to a new idea or theory about the Black archive.2) redefining my ideas of the Black archive: this course really expanded my thinking about what an archive could be. I  enjoyed how we looked at different forms of archiving such as film, photography, and even forms of non-materiality like the ocean.3) interdisciplinary archival methods: I  really enjoyed this interdisciplinary class.

This coupled with the alternative forms of archival memory (photography, play writing, filmmaking, etc.) will definitely be useful in my disseration writing. 
Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis. We were able to tailor our questions or responses to the creator of said texts, rather than spending time on speculating possibilities of textual analysis. I found this interview style of class to be highly beneficial to my appreciation of what we were learning, and it further birthed analytical queries as to what the text entailed. 
Finally, hearing the responses from my classmates as to their analysis of what had been covered that week was beneficial to my understanding of the text, and helped me to think through the class in a fulfilling manner."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, this course introduced me to archival work in the practical, applied definition of the term. I was essentially going in blind although with the understanding that the archival process was (and is) front and center in my research and scholarly aspirations more generally. Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

Additionally, the professors brought in some guest lecturers for some classes, and we were able to take a trip to the Schomburg library in New York City. I really enjoyed all the parts of the class! I liked how the readings included both classics in Black archival thought and some emerging research and artworks. These ideas were all new to me, even though I had taken classes about archives before. I suppose those focused more on literature by white people. However, these readings were all engaging and expanded my worldview a lot. The guest lecturers were all super nice in answering all of our questions and giving overviews of their work, which helped a lot in imagining how archival research can manifest in different genres of art. The trip to the Schomburg was also incredibly special. I had never been to Harlem before, and it was wonderful to see how Black thought and art could have really grown in times like the Harlem Renaissance. The Schomburg as a library was also really unique, and I felt lucky to have experienced it."

I'll keep it simply by saying that all of the above should be kept in forthcoming iterations of the course. The addition of public lectures and events was also very successful, as it not only augmented the learning environment and our grasp of course material, but it also allowed us to interact on a quite intimate level with invited scholars and other experts. This as well is, I think, worth retaining. I also always appreciated and found extremely useful Chris and Khwezi's insights and (let's call them, casual or impromptu) lectures.

Creative Engagement with Archival Material: Through our exposure to artists, writers, and scholars who use the archive as both material and metaphor, I developed new ways of thinking about memory, storytelling, and resistance. The course showed me how archives can be reimagined through poetry, performance, and visual art.
Diasporic and Transnational Thinking: I learned to think across geographies and histories—connecting the Black experience in the U.S., South Africa, and other parts of the diaspora. The course challenged me to think about the global entanglements of anti-Blackness and creative survival."

With each of the readings, I was introduced to a new idea or theory about the Black archive.2) redefining my ideas of the Black archive: this course really expanded my thinking about what an archive could be. I  enjoyed how we looked at different forms of archiving such as film, photography, and even forms of non-materiality like the ocean.3) interdisciplinary archival methods: I  really enjoyed this interdisciplinary class.

This coupled with the alternative forms of archival memory (photography, play writing, filmmaking, etc.) will definitely be useful in my disseration writing. 
Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis. We were able to tailor our questions or responses to the creator of said texts, rather than spending time on speculating possibilities of textual analysis. I found this interview style of class to be highly beneficial to my appreciation of what we were learning, and it further birthed analytical queries as to what the text entailed.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, this course introduced me to archival work in the practical, applied definition of the term. I was essentially going in blind although with the understanding that the archival process was (and is) front and center in my research and scholarly aspirations more generally. Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

However, these readings were all engaging and expanded my worldview a lot. The guest lecturers were all super nice in answering all of our questions and giving overviews of their work, which helped a lot in imagining how archival research can manifest in different genres of art.

Professor McInnis was so knowledgeable about his field that I would often stay after class to ask him about specific passages or unique real world applications of what we go over in class, and he would always take the time to answer my questions thoroughly.Lastly, Professor McInnis would always make sure to find time to meet with me for office hours outside of class if I needed it.

Take the time to read every assigned reading thoroughly(even the optional ones). Each reading has a unique message or purpose. Secondly, don't be afraid to take a risk in discussion or writing and don't be afraid to question. On the blog posts, it can seem tempting to write about a surface level theme, but try to dig deeper and explore a complex theme. Professor McInnis loves when students have a unique perspective on a reading.Lastly, and maybe most importantly, get to know Professor McInnis. By getting to know Professor McInnis, you start to see how truly passionate he is about his work and his courses. When I flunched Professor McInnis, I got to ask all about his career and research. I got to see how knowledgeable he is in his field and how much he cares about what he teaches. By getting to know professor McInnis, I became very comfortable discussing topics with him during class, which made the class that much more engaging."

The note-taking is also extremely useful as it provides a resource for students to go back to when they might have forgotten something from a class discussion.

(For example, I honestly had NO idea that black women slaves were the unwilling subjects who gave us the practice of gynecology we have today.) I also learned how to digest large readings and get the main takeaways as we discussed them during class. As a cis white woman, I do want to mention how I came into this class not having a ton of background on these subjects and I now have learned so much that I will apply in the medical field - like taking into account the history of practices, understanding how livelihoods and backgrounds should be considered, and understanding how my own biases could impact my work on any individual."

The readings can be lengthy at times, but if there is something you don't understand it will more than likely be clarified in class. Professor Piot lectures by asking the class questions about the readings. When a student answers, he always repeats the answers which was awesome because some students spoke very quietly. I also loved the office hours. Each time before we had an essay due I would go to office hours and they were always so happy to provide a lot of guidance. Their advice let me know exactly what they were looking for. Very helpful!"

The essay topics were very fun to write about. I would recommend going to office hours before writing them. The TAs are extremely helpful and you can ask them literally anything. They also tell you exactly what they are looking for in the essay. The exams were good too. The way to do well on them is to go to every class (though attendance isn't required) and just write down everything that is said. If you understand your notes and read them before the test, you will do well. The test consisted of true/false questions to start and then a bunch of short answer questions. A lot of people didn't do well on the true/false section so they ended up curving that part. Overall, the course was really cool and you learn a lot about money, even though you would think you know everything about it given how common it is."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I developed an alternative perspective on prisons in this course that I would not have gained by observing the media or general society. I gained an idea of what prison conditions are really like and how they compare to prisons in other countries around the world. I also acquired the skill of strategically reading a long academic article and picking out what is important as opposed to reading the entire thing closely. Lastly, I developed more of a capacity to humanize those that tend to be demonized or looked down upon in our society."

I would keep the in-class documentaries and demonstrations we watched (like the different prison clothes we explored on the website). These broke up the monotony of just reading and talking about it and let people reset their brains to then have another discussion after it ends. Many of them were also very enjoyable too."

I also very much appreciated the scaffolding of the final paper; it allowed me to not procrastinate the paper and deeply consider my writing over a longer period of time. The activities where we were put in the place of prisoners were also very eye opening and allowed me to truly envision what these people have to go through.

Analyzing Lovecraft Country alongside academic readings made the material both accessible and thought-provoking. Class discussions were essential for unpacking layered themes and allowed for collaborative learning. Assignments like comparing media themes with historical and cultural realities helped deepen my understanding.

Tim Tyson was arrogant, condescending, and the exact opposite of what I would expect to see in a member of Duke Faculty. To start, he went on an anti semetic rant in class where he said ""no one talks about jew power, but they quietly have power through the banking industry"". While I am not jewish, to see this behavior from a member of such a prestigious university was disgusting. One of my friends in the class is Jewish, and the fact that he had to sit and listen to professor Tysons' ridiculous comments were insane. I also feel very afraid to take action regarding these comments, because Tyson has been extremely vindictive throughout the semester. For example, the majority of the class got an extremely poor grade on the midterm. Instead of trying to help students improve, he said ""if I had taken the test I would have gotten a 100"". I was one of the fortunate few students who got a B (most got a C, D, or F) however he still refused to respond to an email I sent asking him for help in the class. I hope that there is some training given to Tyson in the future to fix his anti semetic and belittling behavior."

On the first day of class Tyson stated that we would have hard conversations that would help us grow. Not a single real conversation about racial relations in the south happened in this class. Instead, each week Tyson would get up there and ramble for the first 90 minutes of class. He is one of the least engaging speakers I have ever listened to. The only reprieve the class would have from Tysons rambling was when professor Williams would get up and sing. Her singing was amazing and was the only positive of each class. When it comes to the readings, Tyson assigned multiple expensive books that he wrote himself. I know that this is common for most professors, however it was extremely frustrating because the books were no different than what he discussed in class. Additionally his two most popular books have been discredited with his Emmitt Till Book being described in one news article as ""Tysons Tall Tales"". I have no problem paying for a book that will enhance my learning. However, when the book is filled with lies made up by a professor who does not care about his students I have a problem purchasing them."

If you want students to engage with the class, it would be nice if the professor was at least awake. When he woke up, he proceeded to make passive aggressive comments about students in the class not paying attention. He was particularly passive aggressive to athletes in the class and he seemed to have a clear bias against student athletes.

Instead, the professors tend to repeat the same stories and narratives, which does not facilitate further learning or comprehension of the material. The note cards allow students to formulate their own thoughts and make connections to the readings, but during class, the discussions are heavily focused on the professors' perspectives, leaving little room for students to share their insights or explore their connections to the topics."

Initially, a take-home midterm was listed in the syllabus, but about a week before the midterm, it was abruptly changed to an in-class midterm without proper notice or consent from the students. By the time grades were returned for that midterm, the deadline to take the class on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis or withdraw had already passed. Additional assignments were introduced after this deadline, and the final exam was no longer the sole examination, contrary to what was stated in the syllabus. The grading is stringent, with all assessments being written responses, and any deviation from the professor's expected answers can result in low or even zero scores, immediately impacting overall grades. Throughout the course, students do not have access to a visible grade book or platform like Canvas, making it challenging to track their progress as the syllabus and assignments continue to change unexpectedly. To perform well, memorizing terms from the assigned readings is essential, as outside information is often dismissed, and only definitions from the specified texts are accepted for full credit."

Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis.

Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

Additionally, the professors brought in some guest lecturers for some classes, and we were able to take a trip to the Schomburg library in New York City. I really enjoyed all the parts of the class! I liked how the readings included both classics in Black archival thought and some emerging research and artworks. These ideas were all new to me, even though I had taken classes about archives before. I suppose those focused more on literature by white people. However, these readings were all engaging and expanded my worldview a lot. The guest lecturers were all super nice in answering all of our questions and giving overviews of their work, which helped a lot in imagining how archival research can manifest in different genres of art. The trip to the Schomburg was also incredibly special. I had never been to Harlem before, and it was wonderful to see how Black thought and art could have really grown in times like the Harlem Renaissance. The Schomburg as a library was also really unique, and I felt lucky to have experienced it."

I'll keep it simply by saying that all of the above should be kept in forthcoming iterations of the course. The addition of public lectures and events was also very successful, as it not only augmented the learning environment and our grasp of course material, but it also allowed us to interact on a quite intimate level with invited scholars and other experts. This as well is, I think, worth retaining. I also always appreciated and found extremely useful Chris and Khwezi's insights and (let's call them, casual or impromptu) lectures. They clearly wanted to cultivate a discussion based classroom, and thus their input was not lecture heavy. Instead, their insights were laced and interwoven into the overall class discussion, which was to the benefit of the learning environment."

Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis.

Additionally, the professors brought in some guest lecturers for some classes, and we were able to take a trip to the Schomburg library in New York City. I really enjoyed all the parts of the class! I liked how the readings included both classics in Black archival thought and some emerging research and artworks. These ideas were all new to me, even though I had taken classes about archives before. I suppose those focused more on literature by white people. However, these readings were all engaging and expanded my worldview a lot. The guest lecturers were all super nice in answering all of our questions and giving overviews of their work, which helped a lot in imagining how archival research can manifest in different genres of art. The trip to the Schomburg was also incredibly special. I had never been to Harlem before, and it was wonderful to see how Black thought and art could have really grown in times like the Harlem Renaissance. The Schomburg as a library was also really unique, and I felt lucky to have experienced it."

The addition of public lectures and events was also very successful, as it not only augmented the learning environment and our grasp of course material, but it also allowed us to interact on a quite intimate level with invited scholars and other experts. This as well is, I think, worth retaining. I also always appreciated and found extremely useful Chris and Khwezi's insights and (let's call them, casual or impromptu) lectures. They clearly wanted to cultivate a discussion based classroom, and thus their input was not lecture heavy.

I often hear the saying that college is a time to learn about things that you will never have the opportunity to learn about again. In 20 years, I can always pick up a textbook and learn about mathematical concepts or chemistry, but I will never again get to sit in a room and discuss such important topics that affect society. This class changes the way that you think about the world around you. It allows you to see aspects of society that you would never notice on the surface."

Take the time to read every assigned reading thoroughly(even the optional ones). Each reading has a unique message or purpose. Secondly, don't be afraid to take a risk in discussion or writing and don't be afraid to question. On the blog posts, it can seem tempting to write about a surface level theme, but try to dig deeper and explore a complex theme. Professor McInnis loves when students have a unique perspective on a reading.Lastly, and maybe most importantly, get to know Professor McInnis. By getting to know Professor McInnis, you start to see how truly passionate he is about his work and his courses. When I flunched Professor McInnis, I got to ask all about his career and research. I got to see how knowledgeable he is in his field and how much he cares about what he teaches. By getting to know professor McInnis, I became very comfortable discussing topics with him during class, which made the class that much more engaging."

Additionally, the professor's lectures tended to go onto tangents about completely unrelated topics and overgeneralized the Black experience. I remember the professor once asking the class, ""Who runs the Black household?"" Ignoring the fact that the class was majority non-Black, the professor assumed everyone would emphatically answer ""women,"" but that assumes so much. What if your students don't have mothers? What if your students are from a multiracial household? There were so many moments when the professor made gendered generalizations of the Black experience, which always seemed to just be grounded in his own experience. These generalizations of women were often meant to be positive, but the professor's support of women almost always felt patronizing. And, when given the opportunity to really interrogate the gender parity and its psychosocial impact on Black women, there was nothing to be said."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I developed ways of connecting knowledge between the past and the present and attempted to apply complex economic and ethical theories to modern-day life. I also learned about the history of Capitalism, which has informed the way that I view the modern economic system, especially in the US. Finally, I learned about Marxism and Karl Marx's life which also provided me enough historical background to get a better understanding of capitalism as a system."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","My major is not related to history at all so there was a lot that I learned in this course that I was not introduced to before. The main thing that helped me was that we discussed our readings in class, and although some of the readings were “dense” or hard to understand, Dr. Shareef was sure to explain what the readings meant and to go over anything that we didn’t understand. After these discussions, I was able to get a clearer picture of the origins of capitalism and how our readings were tied together."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I developed the skill of engaging with texts deeper through asking questions, taking in depth annotations, and making connections with other texts. This class has caused me to ask more questions when reading texts because of the historical claims the authors make pertaining to capitalism and labor. It is important to ask questions in order to increase understanding of the text. Additionally, I learned to take more in-depth annotations because of the semester project that requires students to analyze a text and explain its context, its value, and its views on labor and its laws. Additionally, there are certain terms in the class that are discussed in several texts, this has encouraged me to make comparisons among various texts in order to increase complex understanding."

If you keep up with the course readings and you like to engage in a lot of group discussions, then I do believe that this course could be intellectually stimulating for you, however once you get behind, it is difficult to catch up. There are really only two assignments of the midterm and the final project. However be careful which project you pick because one definitely requires more personal investment than the other. Professor Shaharazard is a wonderful person and definitely brings some enthusiasm to class as she is very passionate about the topics in this course. However, the way she leads class can be all over the place, so if you are someone that appreciates a lot of structure in the classroom, attending this class can often feel like a waste of time."

History always appeared segmented, but this history class displayed how universal forms of oppression and sentiments of freedom are. I additionally learned the power of history from below. Analyzing the writings and stories of often overlooked figures, it made it clear how distorted history really is as the predominant narrative encompassing history surrounds powerful white men.

Occasionally, we also had primary source workshops or a visit to the Rubenstein Library that would help fine-tune my ability to analyze primary sources. This structure allowed me to examine the topics we were learning about in several different ways and kept the atmosphere engaging."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

Throughout the semester, we learned about the different laws, social norms, and cultural movements that contributed to the development and continuation of racism. Most importantly, the class discussed the effects of said racism, and explored how they've continued to ensure white supremacy in modernity.
