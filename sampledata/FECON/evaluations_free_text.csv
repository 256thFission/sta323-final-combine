He makes a big point about connecting your personal interests to a job that will ensure your success. John frequently brought in guest speakers who were successful alums and some had even taken his course in the past; that provided invaluable insight on what it is actually like to work in finance, whether that was capital markets/VC/PE/HF/banking. Class was also split up into groups to do updates on the markets at the start of class, which were always high quality and generated great discussion.

Dr. Fullenkamp did not kill my passion for finance, but he did damage my passion for learning as a student and my faith in professors that they truly have their students' best interests in mind.

However, being a student who has already completed Econ 210 and 372, the pace of the class felt slow with a lot of overlapping material. I know the class is meant to be accessible to anyone having taken Econ 101, but I wish it didn't take us until April to talk about Quantitative Easing, Open Market Operations, and the like. Perhaps in the future, this class could serve as a disjunctive prerequisite, together with Econ 210 and Econ 372, for an advanced monetary policy class taught by Professor Meade that glosses over the overlap and then dives straight into applications and monetary policy. Prof. Meade was keen to stay after class and talk more about certain topics or answer questions in class, which I am very appreciative of. Generally speaking, I thought she catered the class to a wide enough audience, easy for anyone willing to learn to understand. The breadth of audience can just be a blessing and a curse depending on the student. It may also just be that the topic of monetary policy has a lot to cover in 1 semester. -Liam"

For midterms, you're responsible for everything in class, assignmed homework, and corresponding sections in the textbook you maybe didn't cover. I'd say that you get a good deal out of the course, and you can get much more if you buy in by doing your research and asking questions.

The model part is very practical and useful, and I really appreciate learning this much about the model. The final paper is such a big project (single space almost killed me tbh), but doing research about the prompt was fun. I personally feel like writing a final paper is better than taking an exam again because the content we learned in class is very hard to be presented in short answers on paper. Also for the midterm, I really struggled when doing the close-book part because for some concepts, I know what it means but it's hard to explain it in my way. The model part is ok and I feel like my preparation for the model part did work. That's probably why I hated the single-spaced 10-page final paper but was still happy when I learned that it's a paper instead of a final exam."

But it's still fun. The content is very solid. Do the readings so that you at least know what the class is talking about. Enjoy the model building part. Prof. Egger is very knowledgeable and he put lots of effort into the class. Obviously he's an excellent learner and he knows A LOT about this field. You'll learn a lot from him."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course significantly enhanced my skills and confidence in macroeconomic forecasting, data analysis, and public speaking. Through assignments like top-down profit reports, I developed a deeper understanding of connecting macro trends to industry implications, which made me feel like a professional in the field I covered. My proficiency in R programming grew substantially, enabling me to work independently on complex analyses and even impress professors in other classes. Additionally, the iterative process of presenting and responding to diligence questions transformed my public speaking skills. I went from nervous and frantic in early presentations to confident and composed by the end, a growth that has positively impacted my performance in other classes as well."

It's not a crazy amount of work, but you do have to apply yourself and it makes you actually learn and understand. Working in groups that are really made sure to work collaboratively was another aspect of the course that was enjoyable."

Starting each class with macro trivia was an excellent way to stimulate macroeconomic thinking and foster dynamic discussions between the Professor Aguilar and students, which often deepened my understanding of the topics. I also appreciated the coding sessions, where the instructor’s preparation of a clear and detailed .qmd file made it easy to follow along and stay on pace. The balance of interactive discourse and practical coding exercises ensured we consistently covered the material while encouraging intellectual curiosity. I deeply valued Professor Aguilar’s insights, both in class and through his online blog, and would recommend keeping these elements for future years to maintain this effective and engaging learning experience."
