It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at Duke. To be fair, I already knew I loved Shakespeare before I took the class, but it seems like even students who weren’t as experienced with Shakespeare enjoyed the class. You will have to do a lot of reading— it helps if you watch the plays instead of just reading them (take advantage of Duke Libraries’ access to wonderful productions by companies like the RSC, Stratford Festival of Canada, and Globe Theater), but also have a copy with good notes in the margins (like the Folger or Arden edition). There are only two major written assignments, which means that each one counts a lot in your grade, but I didn’t mind because it meant that for most of the course we could focus on reading the plays and discussing them in class."

Professor D'Alessandro created a super warm, fun, and welcoming class environment that fostered a lot of lively discussion about the text and got everyone engaged regardless of their personal background (or lack thereof) with theater. He was always willing to chat about the text and clearly cared about us as students and people. I liked the pace of the class—I felt super accomplished that I read like 2 texts a week in the class. I like the response posts and the fact that they are on Monday was helpful because I could read and think over the weekend and felt like I could take risk because there was low-stakes grading. I really enjoy the lectures at the start of class, especially learning about a playwright's background and watching clips of the texts live. The conference structure before essays was helpful. My peer review drafts were always horrible but at least they forced me to get something on the page.

He is so passionate about the material and bring the energy to each and every class period. He makes me want to consume the material and think deeply about the concepts. His passion, energy, vibrance, knowledge, and enthusiasm alone puts him in the upper tier of teachers I've had at Duke.However, I will say that his lack of experience teaching does show sometimes, as he occasionally will go on long, hardly-related tangents and/or talk over the class and speak for the vast majority even when its supposed to be discussion. However, these will improve with time and feedback, and Devon truly has a passion (and knack) for teaching that he must keep pursuing!"

I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy.""

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Johann did a great job of creating a comfortable environment for novice actors. Many of us were nervous about doing something that took us so far out of our comfort zones, but the environment was very non-judgemental. He always spoke with kindness and positive reinforcement. He showed incredible kindness to me which I always appreciated.I would definitely recommend that he keep the ""walk through space."" Why? It was a great way to set the tone for a class, create somewhat of a surreal atmosphere, and overall made me feel ready to act. 
I recommend that he keep the monologues. Why? having that individual attention on me was very uncomfortable at first, but I (and I think most of the class would agree) I became more confident and it was nice to see that development. I think you should also keep giving students the option to choose which monologue of the three we did to do. I thought giving us that choice was liberating and allowed us to target our strengths.I also recommend that he continue assigning live plays for students to watch. During those performances, I thought about practices that the actors or directors did and recognized how they connected to theories or experiences I learned about / had in our class. Seeing live plays added to the learning experience.I also recommend that he keep the self-selected play. Why? It was a great way for student to cultivate their theatre identities. By having the choice to choose any modern play, we chose the monologue that most clearly represented us."

It requires the courage to let yourself go somewhere out of one's comfort zone in front of many watching eyes. That pressure definitely added a complex and stimulating layer to everything that we had already put into acting.Scoring a text was incredibly stimulating. Why? It was like creating a whole world, using the text as the foundation. As we used the text, context, research, etc. to create a compelling monologue, this practice reflected creativity, which is the highest point on Bloom's Taxonomy, a hierarchy reflecting how stimulating learning activities are.Overall, the emphasis Johann placed on make deliberate choices within our acting made the course stimulating."

She does only A, B, C, and D, so if you get below a 93, that's where the B begins. Just be aware because there are only five assignments, each worth 20 points, so you can't get off more than seven points total or else you'll get a B. 
There is also a research project towards the beginning of the semester that takes a substantial amount of time. You may not be told that you have to memorize a song for the performance part of that project, but if you bring in sheet music and refer to it when you sing, you will get points off. Prepare your song as if it's an audition. In your music video project, don't deviate from your previously-submitted plan without talking to Chauntee' first, as you will get points off if your final product is different than your plan.
Chauntee' gives good feedback on singing and acting, so I enjoyed working with her overall."

Overall though, if you have any interest in theater or management the class is very interesting. If you have no background in theater the class does cover most of what you would need to know. The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

It's awesome."

I think this is most notable with the performances in Page Auditorium. I will also say this course has helped me network/ reach out when working with my community partner.

It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at Duke. To be fair, I already knew I loved Shakespeare before I took the class, but it seems like even students who weren’t as experienced with Shakespeare enjoyed the class. You will have to do a lot of reading— it helps if you watch the plays instead of just reading them (take advantage of Duke Libraries’ access to wonderful productions by companies like the RSC, Stratford Festival of Canada, and Globe Theater), but also have a copy with good notes in the margins (like the Folger or Arden edition). There are only two major written assignments, which means that each one counts a lot in your grade, but I didn’t mind because it meant that for most of the course we could focus on reading the plays and discussing them in class."

In terms of costumes, I learned of the new frontiers of costume technology, such as fiber optic lights and thermochromic material, and how they are applied to theater. In a more ""ways of thinking,"" aspect, I was surprised at how the same text can inspire countless variations in different settings, time periods, eras, etc. (and that these can also be seen on the stage, such as the Tempest that took place on a cruise or a women's prison)."

The course also provided ample opportunities to refine my concept development skills. I learned to take my understanding of a text and expand it into a comprehensive concept. While the course didn't specifically emphasize the quality and completeness of concepts, I dedicated time to enhance my ability in this area.
Lastly, I cultivated the skill of critiquing my peers' work. I gained insights into their thought processes and the journey leading to their final products.

If you enjoy theater and want to get more experience on the playwright side, take this class. If you have no experience in writing or theater and want a fun and rewarding creative outlet, take this class. Come to class ready to engage with your peers' scripts, but that may not even need to be said because everyone in the class was eager to read each others' scripts. The only possible reason I can fathom that someone wouldn't be satisfied with this class is if they didn't put in any effort; this was not the case of anyone I know who's taken it, but I suppose in the abstract it is theoretically possible. I would STILL encourage that person to take this class because even shy or ""too-cool-for-the-arts"" students will get a kick out of this class.

This organized scheme enabled me to efficiently track my learning.He offered us the chance to create our own class structure. From the first day, he taught us how to develop our own teaching methods. Gradually, he relinquished his authority as a teacher, allowing us to become both students and teachers simultaneously. This experience taught me creativity and hopefulness.In this course, I learned to be socially aware and humane. David emphasized how dialogue is the cornerstone of human connection and growth. A key concept, the I-Thou method by Martin B., was central to the course. It involves understanding the navigation (words) between different universes (people's minds) and their collisions (dialogue). The course showed me that dialogue is about being sensitive to those around us, a process of discovering and creating with a person rather than labeling them."

This was a refreshing respite from the monotonous learn, study, test of a typical Duke course that made me genuinely excited to both show up for the class and do classwork outside of class. The anarchic structure of the class facilitated my learned because there was no preset content that restricted students from learning what they collectively felt was important. If an unforeseen topic arose, it was welcomed and explored rather than shut down due to divergence from a set plan. Overall, I would say I would keep the methods of instruction the same for future years. However, this is not possible because the structure lay within the body of students that comprises the class and the teacher that comes along with it. So, perhaps keeping the instructor is all that can be done to try and make a class as successful and engaging as The Dialogue Laboratory of Fall 2023."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The class's structure was broad and wide open to student interpretation. Dr. Landes created an environment in which we found consensus about our goals in the laboratory together and pursued them as a group of individuals always trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. The course's lack of pre-imposed structure was filled by a group dynamic where we'd explore the parts of dialogue we found most fascinating, which were often influenced by readings we'd do before class.There was a predefined structure to the extent that we'd come to class and converse with each other, share our thoughts and try to understand each other better. Also, Dr. Landes would step into the conversation and try to steer it to match group consensus and address runaway analysis among the group, bringing us back to the emotional basis of the conversation.Overall, the structure was ideal for this kind of laboratory. We'd read the background knowledge required to understand our own goals and to create a mutual understanding about the role of our laboratory in achieving them, and we'd structure class itself around those goals dynamically. This allowed us to pursue the ideas we found most interesting to a much greater depth, and allowed us to pursue our experimental aims free of restrictive class structure.I would keep the entire class structure into the future."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Our assignments employed a unique and effective method for teaching dialogue. After each class, we were tasked with creating three distinct reports: a reading reflection, a field report, and a laboratory report. This trilogy was fascinating, as each component required a different set of skills. Reading reflections improved our ability to recall and apply the most personally significant concepts from the readings. Field reports challenged us to apply classroom concepts in our daily lives. The laboratory reports, being the most crucial, helped us understand our individual and collective roles in the specific context and timeframe of each class. Essentially, we discussed the unique or local knowledge we created in our dialogue class.From this class, I learned that the most lasting concepts for the future include: ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"" which highlighted learning and teaching as transformational processes and critiqued the current educational system's dampening effect on our desire to transform the world; ""Creating Safe Spaces and Brave Spaces,"" emphasizing the importance of fostering transformation and hope for a better world; ""Thought Leaders in Dialogue Theory,"" demonstrating that the idea of transformational praxis is not only advocated by Davis but has been systematically studied; ""Kairos,"" stressing the importance of speaking at the right moment; ""Social Choreography,"" encouraging a unique perspective on social interactions through spatial organization and people's responses; and ""Semantic and Poetic Meaning,"" contrasting how semantic meaning often falls short in expressing complex emotions like love, whereas poetic meaning can capture these nuances."

Aside from readings, this class was entirely focused on the people in Social Sciences 109 from 3:05-5:35 every Tuesday. The in-class dialogue was always entertaining because students had the choice to stimulate themselves with whatever dialogue they saw fit for the moment (kairos). However, a lot of my intellectual stimulation actually came from the weekly assignments. It was in these assignments that I did the most self-discovering and produced mind-blowing realizations or connections from both inside and out of the classroom."

We created a group mind that truly tried, and often succeeded wildly, at understanding the feelings underlying our curiosity and addressing those points we were most interested in seeing addressed.These curiosities varied throughout the year, but letting dialogue succeed in bringing them forward meant that they were addressed to almost just the right depth and were constantly the focus of the class. So, for example, this class was intellectually stimulating in that it tested how language choices effected the way others responded to language, and also in how other dialogic choices such as body language tone and positional landmarks created different effects on dialogue. Whatever the specific hypotheses of the class demanded, we explored with one another. We got to see the effect of our interests in action, answering them more holistically. Finally, we refined the skills of approaching others and creating a group mind in action, which is something that can only be learned from experience.Its a very abstract course in some ways, but when the laboratory starts cooking it becomes very real and very personal in a matter of minutes. I think seeing how our abstractions related to real emotions was the most stimulating part of the course."

The most stimulating aspect for me was the ability to express identity using both an intellectual and humane component. In every session, we were evaluated on a participation basis, which kept our brains active, encouraging us to think critically, openly, and humanely. I am considering taking this class again and feel that every professor should experience it too, as it fosters a sense of connection and applies the concept of 'scinus'—a genius arising from collective thought processes. This class has the potential to transform our rigid and erratic perceptions of growth. It encourages us to think collectively and individually, challenging the notion that society must be entirely individualistic."

This class focuses on learning how to brainstorm and create collaboratively. It's pointless if you only focus inward. Engage with ideas and concepts, and train yourself to understand the perspectives of those around you while exploring new ways of interacting with them. Most importantly, set your own expectations for your role in the course. It's a journey of personal exploration, so don't merely mimic others' behaviors. Instead, understand why they act as they do and how this understanding can enhance your interactions with them. Develop your own style; there's no right or wrong. Identify your objectives and be true to yourself."

Second, I discovered how a group of strangers sitting in a circle can create an entirely new ""collective consciousness"" through dialogue, where our shared understanding becomes deeper than any one person's individual thoughts. Finally, and most importantly, I learned that what seems like ""just talking"" is actually an incredibly complex dance of human connection, where every word, pause, and response shapes not only our conversation but who we become as people."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I learned to see conversations as a way to build meaning collaboratively, not just exchange ideas. I'm an international student, and taking this course with Prof. Landes has given me the language and toolbox to approach everyday conversations as fun toys rather than something we just ""do"". Notably, I don't think the course gave me ""new tools"" or ""tips and tricks"" for having conversation, but rather gave me (1) a space and a community to experiment with and get honest voices and advice about my communication, and (2) a language to explicate what might feel ""right"" or ""wrong"" within a conversation and what each action might contribute to a conversation.- I started recognizing that every interaction is shaped by interpretive lenses, helping me better analyze the dynamics at play. This idea was also formed in his past class (WRIT 101) and it plays hand-in-hand perfectly with this class. Two extremely impactful ideas that I continuously repeat to my friends that I've learned throughout my time learning with him were that (1) there is no such thing as an ""objective"" or ""true"" lens, and (2) particularities--not generalities--foster the relatability within a narrative/story. Definitely use the language we built in this class over interpretive lenses in my everyday life.- I realized the value of embracing ambiguity and using it to explore deeper, more nuanced perspectives rather than seeking immediate clarity. A lot of the people that come in are CS/Engineering majors that are very used to the dry-cut communication of numbers and fact (self-included). This course (and Prof. Landes' approach) give us a culture shock that ""useless"" conversations are where true humanity shows up and how people connect."

The weekly ""lab reports"" were genius because they forced me to process and analyze what happened in our discussions, helping me see patterns and dynamics I would have totally missed otherwise.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I've taken WRIT 101 and WRIT267S with Prof. Landes back-to-back. I've had a lot of conversations him inside and outside of the class, and he has definitely earned my full respect over the year or so that I've met him. It's the type of respect that comes when you know someone is *extremely* convinced and in love with what they do and put in the time to understand it and study it well. Once you speak to him and understand the context of his experience in the past, who he taught, his hobbies, you gain more and more of an appreciation to his relationship with the subject. You start to feel like it is his literal baby or ""magnum opus"". Regardless, Prof. Landes leads the class with the mentality of trying to simply enhance your growth, not particularly direct it. He gives advice and treats people as individuals with separate interests and personalities, which makes the class have a very amplified personality. Some of the advice, experiences, and lessons he has shared with me have even contributed to my personal life in an extremely concrete way. Conversations with him are dense with lessons that are applicable to the class and beyond.As for specific components of the course that stood out to me, the focus away from the usual educational banking model and letting the class direct the conversations of the day is definitely the star of the show for me. Prof. Landes is insanely good at letting conversations happen and only talking when he has to or when it adds to the conversation. I felt a real connection with the class for sure. There is a reason why I felt so strongly about taking this class after WRIT 101--similar feelings were felt in that course."

I think the horror genre is fascinating, though I hadn't had much contact with it previously, and it's great that we got to engage with it in an academic context. Professor Bell was great, and I had so much fun with this class. There's a lot of writing, but I think that's a good part of the class. Making myself dive into writing for a new medium (as I had no previous experience with screenwriting) is what really started to give me a sense for what goes into a script.
Stay on top of your long script at the end, though. Checkpoints are built into the class, so don't get behind on them, because that 80 page script is very manageable if broken up over multiple weeks, but very scary if you've let it pile up!"

He is so passionate about the material and bring the energy to each and every class period. He makes me want to consume the material and think deeply about the concepts. His passion, energy, vibrance, knowledge, and enthusiasm alone puts him in the upper tier of teachers I've had at Duke.However, I will say that his lack of experience teaching does show sometimes, as he occasionally will go on long, hardly-related tangents and/or talk over the class and speak for the vast majority even when its supposed to be discussion. However, these will improve with time and feedback, and Devon truly has a passion (and knack) for teaching that he must keep pursuing!"

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The structure of this course was great. First, we started out by learning about the music, set, and costume design, which established the atmosphere for the play and its world. Then, because Shakespeare plays contain a lot language we don't typically use today, we did a lot of tablework to ensure we knew what we were saying when we were on stage. Finally, we went through our scenes in a rehearsal room before moving to the performance space a few weeks before the show started. I think the tablework was very important, especially for a Shakespeare piece, and Jonathan made the long sessions interesting by throwing in interesting bits of trivia. In general, Jonathan was a great director and instructor. He was very welcoming, kind, and understanding. He made a genuine effort to get to know everyone as an individual from the very beginning. He was very receptive to our feedback, and it felt like we were all able to contribute to the creative process because of this. Jonathan is incredibly knowledgeable about Shakespeare and his work, so he provided a lot of valuable insight into what Shakespeare was trying to do in a specific scene or phrase, which helped inform our acting. I felt like I was able to learn a lot because of Jonathan's engaging and informative instruction."

It was important to understand the language not only so you could understand what's happening in a scene and what you're saying, but to better understand the world of these characters. Through the bits of trivia Jonathan threw in, I felt like I was able to better understand their world and why they said the things they said and acted the way they acted. This tablework was intellectually stimulating and crucial to delivering a good performance. Furthermore, it was intellectually stimulating to learn new acting techniques through watching Jonathan and the rest of the cast. Because Jonathan has so much experience, it was really fascinating to observe how he chose to deliver lines or direct a scene, and I learned a lot from this. Since the rest of the cast was so talented, I also learned a lot from being present in rehearsals and getting to watch them. Overall, this class was intellectually stimulating both on- and offstage!"

During the staging of a play, we receive multiple opportunities for feedback from the instructors, proving crucial for the project's continuous development. The suggestions and critiques provided by the instructors in the early stages of the rehearsal process have been particularly beneficial to me. They have helped refine the readability of my play and integrate more advanced techniques into my acting and directing practices."

I've notably honed my communication and coordination abilities, which are invaluable for future involvement in theater productions, given their inherently collaborative nature. However, the current structure of the class isn't conducive to in-depth character development for actors or directors. Its emphasis lies on the overall process of production rather than the individual project's development. Nevertheless, the course proves exceptionally beneficial in providing an overview of what a theater production entails and how to collaboratively create one from inception."

He organized the information clearly and concisely, providing access to all assigned readings, which facilitated our learning progress. This organized scheme enabled me to efficiently track my learning.He offered us the chance to create our own class structure. From the first day, he taught us how to develop our own teaching methods. Gradually, he relinquished his authority as a teacher, allowing us to become both students and teachers simultaneously. This experience taught me creativity and hopefulness.In this course, I learned to be socially aware and humane. David emphasized how dialogue is the cornerstone of human connection and growth. A key concept, the I-Thou method by Martin B., was central to the course. It involves understanding the navigation (words) between different universes (people's minds) and their collisions (dialogue). The course showed me that dialogue is about being sensitive to those around us, a process of discovering and creating with a person rather than labeling them."

If an unforeseen topic arose, it was welcomed and explored rather than shut down due to divergence from a set plan. Overall, I would say I would keep the methods of instruction the same for future years. However, this is not possible because the structure lay within the body of students that comprises the class and the teacher that comes along with it. So, perhaps keeping the instructor is all that can be done to try and make a class as successful and engaging as The Dialogue Laboratory of Fall 2023."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The class's structure was broad and wide open to student interpretation. Dr. Landes created an environment in which we found consensus about our goals in the laboratory together and pursued them as a group of individuals always trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. The course's lack of pre-imposed structure was filled by a group dynamic where we'd explore the parts of dialogue we found most fascinating, which were often influenced by readings we'd do before class.There was a predefined structure to the extent that we'd come to class and converse with each other, share our thoughts and try to understand each other better. Also, Dr. Landes would step into the conversation and try to steer it to match group consensus and address runaway analysis among the group, bringing us back to the emotional basis of the conversation.Overall, the structure was ideal for this kind of laboratory. We'd read the background knowledge required to understand our own goals and to create a mutual understanding about the role of our laboratory in achieving them, and we'd structure class itself around those goals dynamically. This allowed us to pursue the ideas we found most interesting to a much greater depth, and allowed us to pursue our experimental aims free of restrictive class structure.I would keep the entire class structure into the future."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Our assignments employed a unique and effective method for teaching dialogue. After each class, we were tasked with creating three distinct reports: a reading reflection, a field report, and a laboratory report. This trilogy was fascinating, as each component required a different set of skills. Reading reflections improved our ability to recall and apply the most personally significant concepts from the readings. Field reports challenged us to apply classroom concepts in our daily lives. The laboratory reports, being the most crucial, helped us understand our individual and collective roles in the specific context and timeframe of each class. Essentially, we discussed the unique or local knowledge we created in our dialogue class.From this class, I learned that the most lasting concepts for the future include: ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"" which highlighted learning and teaching as transformational processes and critiqued the current educational system's dampening effect on our desire to transform the world; ""Creating Safe Spaces and Brave Spaces,"" emphasizing the importance of fostering transformation and hope for a better world; ""Thought Leaders in Dialogue Theory,"" demonstrating that the idea of transformational praxis is not only advocated by Davis but has been systematically studied; ""Kairos,"" stressing the importance of speaking at the right moment; ""Social Choreography,"" encouraging a unique perspective on social interactions through spatial organization and people's responses; and ""Semantic and Poetic Meaning,"" contrasting how semantic meaning often falls short in expressing complex emotions like love, whereas poetic meaning can capture these nuances."

Aside from readings, this class was entirely focused on the people in Social Sciences 109 from 3:05-5:35 every Tuesday. The in-class dialogue was always entertaining because students had the choice to stimulate themselves with whatever dialogue they saw fit for the moment (kairos). However, a lot of my intellectual stimulation actually came from the weekly assignments. It was in these assignments that I did the most self-discovering and produced mind-blowing realizations or connections from both inside and out of the classroom."

We created a group mind that truly tried, and often succeeded wildly, at understanding the feelings underlying our curiosity and addressing those points we were most interested in seeing addressed.These curiosities varied throughout the year, but letting dialogue succeed in bringing them forward meant that they were addressed to almost just the right depth and were constantly the focus of the class. So, for example, this class was intellectually stimulating in that it tested how language choices effected the way others responded to language, and also in how other dialogic choices such as body language tone and positional landmarks created different effects on dialogue. Whatever the specific hypotheses of the class demanded, we explored with one another. We got to see the effect of our interests in action, answering them more holistically. Finally, we refined the skills of approaching others and creating a group mind in action, which is something that can only be learned from experience.Its a very abstract course in some ways, but when the laboratory starts cooking it becomes very real and very personal in a matter of minutes. I think seeing how our abstractions related to real emotions was the most stimulating part of the course."

The most stimulating aspect for me was the ability to express identity using both an intellectual and humane component. In every session, we were evaluated on a participation basis, which kept our brains active, encouraging us to think critically, openly, and humanely. I am considering taking this class again and feel that every professor should experience it too, as it fosters a sense of connection and applies the concept of 'scinus'—a genius arising from collective thought processes. This class has the potential to transform our rigid and erratic perceptions of growth. It encourages us to think collectively and individually, challenging the notion that society must be entirely individualistic."

I'm an international student, and taking this course with Prof. Landes has given me the language and toolbox to approach everyday conversations as fun toys rather than something we just ""do"". Notably, I don't think the course gave me ""new tools"" or ""tips and tricks"" for having conversation, but rather gave me (1) a space and a community to experiment with and get honest voices and advice about my communication, and (2) a language to explicate what might feel ""right"" or ""wrong"" within a conversation and what each action might contribute to a conversation.- I started recognizing that every interaction is shaped by interpretive lenses, helping me better analyze the dynamics at play. This idea was also formed in his past class (WRIT 101) and it plays hand-in-hand perfectly with this class. Two extremely impactful ideas that I continuously repeat to my friends that I've learned throughout my time learning with him were that (1) there is no such thing as an ""objective"" or ""true"" lens, and (2) particularities--not generalities--foster the relatability within a narrative/story. Definitely use the language we built in this class over interpretive lenses in my everyday life.- I realized the value of embracing ambiguity and using it to explore deeper, more nuanced perspectives rather than seeking immediate clarity. A lot of the people that come in are CS/Engineering majors that are very used to the dry-cut communication of numbers and fact (self-included). This course (and Prof. Landes' approach) give us a culture shock that ""useless"" conversations are where true humanity shows up and how people connect."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I've taken WRIT 101 and WRIT267S with Prof. Landes back-to-back. I've had a lot of conversations him inside and outside of the class, and he has definitely earned my full respect over the year or so that I've met him. It's the type of respect that comes when you know someone is *extremely* convinced and in love with what they do and put in the time to understand it and study it well. Once you speak to him and understand the context of his experience in the past, who he taught, his hobbies, you gain more and more of an appreciation to his relationship with the subject. You start to feel like it is his literal baby or ""magnum opus"". Regardless, Prof. Landes leads the class with the mentality of trying to simply enhance your growth, not particularly direct it. He gives advice and treats people as individuals with separate interests and personalities, which makes the class have a very amplified personality. Some of the advice, experiences, and lessons he has shared with me have even contributed to my personal life in an extremely concrete way. Conversations with him are dense with lessons that are applicable to the class and beyond.As for specific components of the course that stood out to me, the focus away from the usual educational banking model and letting the class direct the conversations of the day is definitely the star of the show for me. Prof. Landes is insanely good at letting conversations happen and only talking when he has to or when it adds to the conversation. I felt a real connection with the class for sure. There is a reason why I felt so strongly about taking this class after WRIT 101--similar feelings were felt in that course."

The entire point of the class is to come in with a bunch of tools from the reading, discuss those tools for 10-20 minutes, then spend 2+ hours having some form of conversation and noticing how it naturally creeps up in conversation. The class is made to simulate an ""ultra-human"" version of normal dialog and conversation, where feelings and opinions are given the spotlight."

As a student, I understand that many students may worry about grading given the odd topic of this course, but Prof. Landes is extremely fair in grading and makes it very clear how to get an A from the very start. More importantly, as a student, I've had multiple people who took this class and WRIT 101 mention the genuine personal growth they gained from this class. Many people entered thinking the course topic was wishy-washy and that this whole course was cringe. However, almost every single person in class had their perspective changed. It's clear to me since every single person in class is naturally involved in the conversation without anyone asking them to be."
