Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this class, I learned the importance of opening up our interpretation of what it means to be healthy. Health is determined by so many factors: our built environment, as shown by our visit to Hayti, structural and individual racism, policies, corruption in Big Food policy-making, corporation-funded research (Tobacco industry), gender norms (the villainization of single black mothers using WIC), and so much more. I learned to consider articles and stories from a humanities perspective, looking at healthcare from a lens of personal narratives. The narratives surrounding issues and history can greatly shape policy and how we interpret the healthcare system. Listening to the voices of community members is essential for cultivating healthy communities. Art can serve communities beyond aesthetics. Art can serve as an avenue of self-expression and direct community betterment. Diction can greatly influence how one's life is displayed. For instance, grief can be a better avenue for addressing systemic racism than guilt. Storytelling and photography can truly highlight the realities of this country's inequalities. I never would have understood the extent to which American gynecology was founded by taking advantage of black female bodies. From biological racism to bioethics and power structures, this class opened my eyes to the ways in which our society can shape our health and perspectives."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The seminar-style nature of the class invoked us to truly think about every component discussed. One thing I'd keep for future years is the Data Story assignment - it was very informative to  understand just how easy it is to manipulate data, and how all of our sources of information present it."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",The reader response was a weekly response on the readings that we engaged in during class. I thought it was a good way to encourage us to “close read” and analyse specific passages of the reading. It was a good way to incentivize us to read carefully as well as hone our writing whilst being low stakes.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I really appreciated how Dr. Callahan guided the class with interesting questions and thoughtful input. I felt that she listened to each response and didn't expect one ""right"" answer. I think the structure of the class with the Reader Responses first and the discussion after allowed us to form our own thoughts, questions, and opinions before hand. I think the discussions flow pretty well and I learn a lot from them. I like the different perspectives people offer. I also really enjoyed the field trip we went on and hearing from the speakers. It helped connect our readings with more concrete real life stories."
