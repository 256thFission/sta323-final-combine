Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I liked having readings each week that we read on our own and then discussed as a class. Dr. Yoder did a good job of explaining the readings, although some aspects of the content were a little confusing. I really liked having no tests so that we could focus on learning the content at our own pace and be curious without worrying about our grade."

Discussions over modern medical implications were very interesting and gave relevance to it all. I also liked the group discussion presentations done in a chronological order to show the progression of research done in this field.

Having the lectures be more concise and digestible, through videos? might be helpful as well."
