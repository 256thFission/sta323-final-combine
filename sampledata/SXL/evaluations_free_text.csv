They are both genuinely interested in the topic, and they try to ensure that their students are engaged and learning. Participation and group work are also a large part of this class and they make up most of your grade."

Yet, I never seemed to have a problem being engaged with lectures and material. The readings assigned before each class were digestible, academically stimulating, and genuinely interesting. Each reading was different too, so nothing felt repetitious. I took the class because I felt studying taboos would be extremely beneficial in understanding social dynamics and systematic structures. I now look at history in a different light, seeing how much voyeurism and sexual pleasure impacted several aspects of society. Moreover, I now understand roots in mass media and understand stigmatized subjects like porn and BDSM in a much more informed light. We know of so many subjects in media and history and yet this class teaches you to see things you never would have before. So many historical and systematic factors became connected through this course."

Yet, I never seemed to have a problem being engaged with lectures and material. The readings assigned before each class were digestible, academically stimulating, and genuinely interesting. Each reading was different too, so nothing felt repetitious. I took the class because I felt studying taboos would be extremely beneficial in understanding social dynamics and systematic structures. I now look at history in a different light, seeing how much voyeurism and sexual pleasure impacted several aspects of society. Moreover, I now understand roots in mass media and understand stigmatized subjects like porn and BDSM in a much more informed light. We know of so many subjects in media and history and yet this class teaches you to see things you never would have before. So many historical and systematic factors became connected through this course."

As someone interested in learning about gender norms, systematic racism, and understanding history as well as the present in a niche and interesting way, this was perfect! I think if a topic is taboo, that means it needs to be better understood. Sex, porn, and hyper-sexualization of certain groups is so prominent in our media and modern reality, and there's so much value in digging deeper into it's roots. If ou are mature enough to handle the material, you should take it. I think it will end up being my favorite class at Duke."
