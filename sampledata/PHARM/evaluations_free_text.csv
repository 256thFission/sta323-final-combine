Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course provided me with a deeper and more holistic understanding of the complexities involved in drug development and treatment. Professor Sawyer did an exceptional job of teaching us not just the biological mechanisms of how drugs work, but also the various biological, physiological, ethical, and societal factors that must be considered when developing and administering treatments. Her approach emphasized that the development of drugs is not just about scientific discovery but also about understanding their real-world impact, including considerations of access, safety, and patient care. This broader perspective helped me appreciate the intricate balance between efficacy and the diverse ethical and practical issues involved in drug therapies.
One of the most valuable skills I developed was the ability to research and write a comprehensive report on a drug's effectiveness, particularly in relation to a specific medical issue, such as vasculitis. I had the opportunity to explore why current treatments were ineffective and collaborate with my peers to propose novel drug solutions. This hands-on project pushed me to think critically about treatment limitations and how to improve them. The experience of designing a clinical trial for the drug was particularly enlightening. It gave me valuable insight into the complex processes of trial design, including identifying variables, ensuring patient safety, and navigating ethical concerns. This knowledge is something I would not have gained without the course and will be essential in my future as a physician.
Perhaps the most profound insight I gained was understanding how drugs affect biological processes and why certain drugs work for some patients but not for others. This realization highlighted the importance of personalized medicine, where treatment plans are tailored to the unique genetic, environmental, and physiological factors of each patient. I now appreciate that drug development and administration are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, they require a humanistic and comprehensive approach that takes into account the full complexity of the patient. This way of thinking—focused on patient individuality and the variability of biological responses—will inform my approach to patient care, ensuring I treat people as whole individuals rather than as cases or conditions to be managed."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The structure and components of this course created an ideal learning environment that blended traditional instruction with active, collaborative learning. I particularly appreciated the balance between didactic lectures, where we were introduced to new information, and the group activities that encouraged us to engage directly with real-world problems. This dual approach allowed me to not only absorb the material but also to apply it in meaningful ways. Working on group projects, especially those addressing real-life issues, made the theoretical concepts we discussed in class feel relevant and tangible. The combination of learning new concepts and immediately using them to think critically and develop solutions was incredibly effective, solidifying my understanding in a way that simply listening to lectures could not have done.
One memorable example of this was the fun in-class activities, like the Halloween project, where we worked in teams to research a topic and present our findings to the class. This was not just an opportunity to deepen our knowledge, but also a chance to develop important skills in teamwork and public speaking. Learning to communicate complex information clearly and effectively is an essential skill in any field, and the experience of presenting to peers in a structured, supportive environment gave me a valuable opportunity to hone this skill. These interactive components, which emphasized collaboration and communication, are aspects of the course I would certainly recommend keeping in future iterations. They contributed to an engaging and dynamic classroom experience that was both intellectually stimulating and personally rewarding.
However, as effective as the course structure and activities were, it was Professor Sawyer’s teaching style and personal example that truly made the learning environment exceptional. She brought a calm, positive energy to every class, fostering an atmosphere where intellectual curiosity thrived. Her respectful and empathetic approach to teaching made me feel seen and heard, allowing me to ask questions and express doubts after class and engage deeply with the material. More than just imparting knowledge, she embodied the values of thoughtfulness, compassion, and ethical integrity. These qualities inspired me to approach learning and, ultimately, my future career with a sense of purpose and responsibility. Professor Sawyer’s influence went far beyond her role as a lecturer; she set a standard for how to teach with care, passion, and respect for students, and I believe that future students will benefit not only from the course’s content and structure but from her example as a role model."

It offers a unique and comprehensive perspective on pharmacology, covering not just the biological and physiological mechanisms of drugs, but also the ethical, societal, and personal considerations that are essential for anyone pursuing a career in healthcare. As future prescribers of medication, understanding how drugs work in the body, the limitations of current treatments, and the complexities of individualized care is vital. This course goes beyond textbook knowledge—it encourages you to think critically about real-world issues, such as why certain treatments may not work for all patients and how to design drugs and clinical trials that can address these disparities. The hands-on activities, particularly the group projects, provide an excellent opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting, sharpening both your problem-solving and communication skills—critical tools for any healthcare professional. If you’re serious about becoming a thoughtful and well-rounded healthcare professional, this class is an invaluable experience."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. I learned the specific definition of addiction and how to design experiments in rodents and humans to test who meets these qualifications.
2. I was able to hear a first hand account of how addiction can develop and what treatment options are like in North Carolina for recovering addicts.
3. I was able to apply my knowledge of drugs learned in this class to create a presentation that looked at real-world drug use across varying ages, demographics, and regions in the U.S."

For example, what would perhaps be interesting is having an ongoing group project / activities where you are each assigned a drug and do research little by little about different aspects like pharmacology, cultural/generational uses, mechanisms, treatment applications, etc. This would make the assignment more engaging and more related to course content. Having group projects all at the end of the class made them less informative / attended by the class. An ongoing project such as this in addition to the in-class/homework assignments would be better than the paper/project that weren't directly related to class content necessarily."

The content was familiar if you'd taken a neuro or bio class. Most people found this course really interesting, and Dr. Kuhn is very lax in her approach to teaching. I didn't care for the course because it was not as interesting as I'd thought, but that isn't to say that this course isn't great and informative for those passionate about this topic. The course was not difficult by any means, and I really enjoyed the variety in the assignments (paper, homework, in-class, take home exams, and group presentation). The amount of work required for this course definitely comes in waves. Sometimes there's a good amount of work when you have an exam, and other times you really have little to do for it."
