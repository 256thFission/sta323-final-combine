Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","This class was awesome! Emily's enthusiasm for the class and the material is evident and contagious. She was an incredibly approachable, flexible, and caring professor and created an environment where it felt like we were really able to think critically while also having fun in a low-stakes environment. The course's selected topics and the sequence in which these topics were presented were logical and coherent. I appreciated that Emily took the time to contextualize each new topic we discussed within the scope of what we had learned thus far. Topics were well-connected and referenced each other, which gave me a deeper appreciation for the course's ethnomusicological lens and each of the individual musics. Emily did a fantastic job of fostering a friendly and supportive class environment. Despite the larger class size, it felt like we were able to have discussions, share ideas, and get to know each other's ways of thinking. Emily also seemed genuinely interested in learning from us, fostering a non-hierarchical classroom environment (versus one where the professor clearly presents as the all-knowing expert uninterested in students' insights) that I think greatly encouraged students' independent thinking. Karaoke was a lot of fun and also helped build camaraderie among the class. I think all of the assignments were meaningful and useful while also leaving plenty of room for our own thinking and creativity (e.g. 3 you pick listening journals and a very open-ended final project). Course assignments were structured in a way that leaves options and appeals to a diversity of strengths and weaknesses (e.g. appealing to those who prefer test-taking vs. essay-writing and to those who prefer independent vs group work). Most of all, this class was fun! It's such a relief to have a class that is genuinely fun, where the professor is also excited to just have fun while still learning a lot."

Her instruction is fantastic, eye-opening, and insightful. She made sure that the classroom was a safe space for knowledge exchange and open discussion, but she also guided us to think at a deeper and more intersectional level. She's one of the best instructors I have in my undergrad!! (And universities, she will be an amazing professor in the classroom!)"

(For example, I honestly had NO idea that black women slaves were the unwilling subjects who gave us the practice of gynecology we have today.) I also learned how to digest large readings and get the main takeaways as we discussed them during class. As a cis white woman, I do want to mention how I came into this class not having a ton of background on these subjects and I now have learned so much that I will apply in the medical field - like taking into account the history of practices, understanding how livelihoods and backgrounds should be considered, and understanding how my own biases could impact my work on any individual."

I think perhaps requiring that students fulfill a prereq before enrolling in the class or submitting a paragraph explaining why they are interested to ensure that everyone who is in the class is generally on the same level to allow for more meaningful and intellectually stimulating conversations. (also have personally overhead students saying they are only taking the course because it fulfills alot of requirements -- which was especially discouraging for myself because i had enrolled with the desire to actually learn based on the course content)"

One specific thing I’ve learned is how to think critically in ways I hadn’t before. Now, when I read a book or watch a movie, I find myself looking for deeper connections. Discussing these ideas in class with my peers has also opened me up to new perspectives, helping me understand the text or media in ways I wouldn’t have on my own.

In addition, there is a food and chinatown ethnography project that let you dive deep into a Chinatown and restaurant, and lastly there is a roleplaying-type game. As someone who doesn't typically enjoy the nature of role-playing games/debate style, I found it extremely fun and interesting, and I wouldn't let this dissuade anyone from taking the course."

The class was incredibly interactive. I would keep all elements of the course. The presentation really helped me learn about the complex history of a Chinatown of our choice. The restaurant ethnography was a fantastic way of learning how to interview others and explore the culture of a space. The game was incredibly exciting, and it taught us how to put ourselves in the shoes of people with different interests at stake (e.g., businessmen, professors, activists, etc.). Professor Chow tried to facilitate events outside of class, like a Hotpot outing, which really helped build class community. She was an incredible lecturer."

(For example, I honestly had NO idea that black women slaves were the unwilling subjects who gave us the practice of gynecology we have today.) I also learned how to digest large readings and get the main takeaways as we discussed them during class. As a cis white woman, I do want to mention how I came into this class not having a ton of background on these subjects and I now have learned so much that I will apply in the medical field - like taking into account the history of practices, understanding how livelihoods and backgrounds should be considered, and understanding how my own biases could impact my work on any individual."

One specific thing I’ve learned is how to think critically in ways I hadn’t before. Now, when I read a book or watch a movie, I find myself looking for deeper connections. Discussing these ideas in class with my peers has also opened me up to new perspectives, helping me understand the text or media in ways I wouldn’t have on my own.

I think perhaps requiring that students fulfill a prereq before enrolling in the class or submitting a paragraph explaining why they are interested to ensure that everyone who is in the class is generally on the same level to allow for more meaningful and intellectually stimulating conversations. (also have personally overhead students saying they are only taking the course because it fulfills alot of requirements -- which was especially discouraging for myself because i had enrolled with the desire to actually learn based on the course content)"

She was an incredibly approachable, flexible, and caring professor and created an environment where it felt like we were really able to think critically while also having fun in a low-stakes environment. The course's selected topics and the sequence in which these topics were presented were logical and coherent. I appreciated that Emily took the time to contextualize each new topic we discussed within the scope of what we had learned thus far. Topics were well-connected and referenced each other, which gave me a deeper appreciation for the course's ethnomusicological lens and each of the individual musics. Emily did a fantastic job of fostering a friendly and supportive class environment. Despite the larger class size, it felt like we were able to have discussions, share ideas, and get to know each other's ways of thinking. Emily also seemed genuinely interested in learning from us, fostering a non-hierarchical classroom environment (versus one where the professor clearly presents as the all-knowing expert uninterested in students' insights) that I think greatly encouraged students' independent thinking. Karaoke was a lot of fun and also helped build camaraderie among the class. I think all of the assignments were meaningful and useful while also leaving plenty of room for our own thinking and creativity (e.g. 3 you pick listening journals and a very open-ended final project). Course assignments were structured in a way that leaves options and appeals to a diversity of strengths and weaknesses (e.g. appealing to those who prefer test-taking vs. essay-writing and to those who prefer independent vs group work). Most of all, this class was fun! It's such a relief to have a class that is genuinely fun, where the professor is also excited to just have fun while still learning a lot."

From the modern pop music in Asia (well, East Asia to be more exact) and Asian America, you actually learn tremendously about the historical reason behind why certain music sounds like a certain way coming from these countries and cultures, and it's a methodology extremely applicable to analyzing the music of other geographies -- we do a lot of cross cultural analysis in music beyond just Asian music as well."
