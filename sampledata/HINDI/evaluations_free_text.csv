Another way my Hindi instructor structured her class that I found very enjoyable was that she implemented different ways to learn Hindi, whether it was through poems, role-play, writing on the board, or having us talk to college students from India, it was all very fun but all so very unique and insightful ways to help us learn Hindi."

Another way my Hindi instructor structured her class that I found very enjoyable was that she implemented different ways to learn Hindi, whether it was through poems, role-play, writing on the board, or having us talk to college students from India, it was all very fun but all so very unique and insightful ways to help us learn Hindi."
