I also found it cool when we read about HeLa and then actually saw her cells in person! That was a very cool field trip that really made the class exciting. I feel like more field trips could be beneficial. In psych, I've heard the professor asks that his students participate in a research study of their choosing. It would be cool to ask students of this class to do the same for an individual or group project and talk about their experience, maybe discuss what makes the study ethical/unethical, etc. It would be cool to sit through an actual consent process from someone conducting a study at Duke."
