This was really helpful as there was a lot of content and reading, so the added structure helped me to be a bit more organized and devote more time to understanding key passages.

The lessons taught throughout the texts were also new to me, so it was interesting seeing how these views differed from my own or just learning about new perspectives I've never previously considered."

I think it could be more stimulating if there was more variety or the ideas of the texts were put into a modern day context."

The Masnavi contains a reference in the back that is especially important to look up, since Rumi makes many metaphors and references that those not familiar with aspects of the Islamic faith are likely to miss. Attar is more comprehensible but he is by nature a poet, and so should also be read in this way.Read the texts very carefully."

If you are interested in art history, architecture, or life during the Renaissance, it is certainly a class you should take. It gives you perspective for when you see old buildings in modern times --- where the architectural elements came from, and why they were initially implemented in the designs. Now when I travel, I can see how different aspects of buildings are derived from different architects' styles and/or ancient times."

It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at Duke. To be fair, I already knew I loved Shakespeare before I took the class, but it seems like even students who weren’t as experienced with Shakespeare enjoyed the class. You will have to do a lot of reading— it helps if you watch the plays instead of just reading them (take advantage of Duke Libraries’ access to wonderful productions by companies like the RSC, Stratford Festival of Canada, and Globe Theater), but also have a copy with good notes in the margins (like the Folger or Arden edition). There are only two major written assignments, which means that each one counts a lot in your grade, but I didn’t mind because it meant that for most of the course we could focus on reading the plays and discussing them in class."

But I think the breadth of work we undertook for this course simply made me a better reader, a better scholar of literature.I learned, in this course, how to compare topics across different disciplines. Comparing Christian theology to Shakespeare's comedies seems a bit of a stretch, at first thought, but I have learned how to hold ideas up against one another even if they are different in form and subject. I loved that we read so many different types of literature in this class, from novel to drama to philosophy.I learned a lot about Christian philosophy, which I think is very necessary for an English major, and maybe not taught quite enough in other courses."

I definitely found that the things I was learning and the literature I was being exposed to were ideas that I was able to apply to contexts outside of our classroom. I do wish that we would spend more time on each texts, especially The Black Prince. Towards the end of the semester it felt like we were trying to get in as much information as possible, and didn't have the ability to explore texts the way that we were with Aristotle and Plato. Additionally, I think the set up of professor lecturing for 10 minutes and then giving us the opportunity to discuss was very effective and hearing the contexts of texts and how they have been interpreted throughout time allowed me to feel more confident in my discussion. Lastly, I appreciated that there was so much freedom in the essay prompts."

Therefore giving me a more understanding perspective of each reading that I discuss with others around me. It helped me learn better about the different components in class. Also doing an actual D&D one-shot helped me understand what we talked about in class about the subject and how it connects to the fantasy genre.

I would argue the best classes continue to reinforce this ""why"" every week, and build upon it, to make sure students continue to clearly see the importance of what they are learning. Otherwise, the class is bound to feel like a waste of time, especially to those students taking it to fulfill a credit or a major requirement. Emily tried to do a little bit of that by having us brainstorm myths we had believed about the middle ages, but this was framed more as a reason for us to be excited about the class, not the reason why we need to learn the things she taught us. I found myself pretty bored and dragging my feet through a lot of this class because it honestly felt a little pointless to me without having a clear understanding of why I should care about a bunch of random kings and successive iterations of Christian doctrine. Not because I believe these things are inherently boring or pointless, but because I was never given a reason to see them as actually important. Again, focusing less on granular details from this broad time period and more on broader trends or viewing it through distinct analytical lenses that reveal larger historical insights might lend itself to highlighting this ""why."""

Wasn't particularly hard because it's just history. I think a little more reasoning into how people felt, what they thought, and what this says about humanity would be nice. I think the most important application of history is that we are studying our ancestors. We've inherited many traits from them. Allow us to avoid their mistakes and emulate their strengths."

Additionally, this class was assigned an undergraduate teaching fellow who was encouraged by Professor Robisheaux to share his perspectives on how to do history, how to read different source materials, and how to structure academic writing.

We thought widely about the phenomenon of the Reformation, while also pointing our attention to the lived experiences of people during this time. Martin Luther, in this course, was expanded from a man who scorned the Catholic Church and wrote ninety-five theses into a young adult in crisis, a tormented thinker, and a figure with complex, oftentimes harmful views of those of varying faiths and identities. Many major players in Europe during this time period received this treatment in the course, but the everyday person was not left out of the story, either. Professor Robisheaux made a pointed effort to consider the laity, the women, the craftspeople, and those from minority groups in his storytelling. The conversations that were inspired by these diverse stories, and insightful perspectives were one of the highlights of my semester. There was always a new point of view, a new source to analyze, and a new method for understanding to be discovered in this class."

I loved studying these historic texts and secondary sources with students outside of my own program, which allowed for new insights and understandings that have shaped the way I approach work in my home discipline. Dr. Martin created a lot of pathways for us to engage with the material, and I appreciated the weekly message board assignment as it allowed for me to engage my classmates and begin a dialogue even before I entered the classroom. This was especially meaningful for a weekly seminar where I only see my classmates once a week, and want to make the most of the time together. Dr. Martin did a great job lightly facilitating the class, but otherwise emphasizing a student-led discussion of the materials. He never discouraged us from pressing a topic or conversation further, even if it didn't directly address the overall seminar topic, and these conversations always ended up being very rich and linking us back to the ideas and concerns that make us interested in studying Columbus in the first place."

The midterm was mostly fair passage identification and some factual information (expecting the final to be similarly fair). The papers were actually quite fun to write because we could choose to write about any translations, parallels, and commentaries we thought were most intriguing, i.e. there was a lot of free rein.

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering. This coupled with an acute sense of self-awareness makes it hard to hate an exiled 14th century Italian man's charisma."

Therefore giving me a more understanding perspective of each reading that I discuss with others around me. It helped me learn better about the different components in class. Also doing an actual D&D one-shot helped me understand what we talked about in class about the subject and how it connects to the fantasy genre.

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

The trips to the library to see first-hand the materials that we were discussing in the class, such as Alberti's 1st edition publications and such, were very cool and made it much easier to remember / build upon."

I would argue the best classes continue to reinforce this ""why"" every week, and build upon it, to make sure students continue to clearly see the importance of what they are learning. Otherwise, the class is bound to feel like a waste of time, especially to those students taking it to fulfill a credit or a major requirement. Emily tried to do a little bit of that by having us brainstorm myths we had believed about the middle ages, but this was framed more as a reason for us to be excited about the class, not the reason why we need to learn the things she taught us. I found myself pretty bored and dragging my feet through a lot of this class because it honestly felt a little pointless to me without having a clear understanding of why I should care about a bunch of random kings and successive iterations of Christian doctrine. Not because I believe these things are inherently boring or pointless, but because I was never given a reason to see them as actually important. Again, focusing less on granular details from this broad time period and more on broader trends or viewing it through distinct analytical lenses that reveal larger historical insights might lend itself to highlighting this ""why."""

We thought widely about the phenomenon of the Reformation, while also pointing our attention to the lived experiences of people during this time. Martin Luther, in this course, was expanded from a man who scorned the Catholic Church and wrote ninety-five theses into a young adult in crisis, a tormented thinker, and a figure with complex, oftentimes harmful views of those of varying faiths and identities. Many major players in Europe during this time period received this treatment in the course, but the everyday person was not left out of the story, either. Professor Robisheaux made a pointed effort to consider the laity, the women, the craftspeople, and those from minority groups in his storytelling. The conversations that were inspired by these diverse stories, and insightful perspectives were one of the highlights of my semester. There was always a new point of view, a new source to analyze, and a new method for understanding to be discovered in this class."

I think this was most effective when we tried to see the perspective of each writer/group instead of being quick to dismiss them.

I do wish that we would spend more time on each texts, especially The Black Prince. Towards the end of the semester it felt like we were trying to get in as much information as possible, and didn't have the ability to explore texts the way that we were with Aristotle and Plato. Additionally, I think the set up of professor lecturing for 10 minutes and then giving us the opportunity to discuss was very effective and hearing the contexts of texts and how they have been interpreted throughout time allowed me to feel more confident in my discussion.

It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at Duke. To be fair, I already knew I loved Shakespeare before I took the class, but it seems like even students who weren’t as experienced with Shakespeare enjoyed the class. You will have to do a lot of reading— it helps if you watch the plays instead of just reading them (take advantage of Duke Libraries’ access to wonderful productions by companies like the RSC, Stratford Festival of Canada, and Globe Theater), but also have a copy with good notes in the margins (like the Folger or Arden edition). There are only two major written assignments, which means that each one counts a lot in your grade, but I didn’t mind because it meant that for most of the course we could focus on reading the plays and discussing them in class."

He is one of the most knowledgeable Dantean scholars out there, and his enthusiasm about Dante is infectious. His slides are so well-curated and he has so many random fun facts, e.g. about Virgil's pesto recipe on the US dollar bill. I thought the reading assignments were well-paced for the most part. The midterm was mostly fair passage identification and some factual information (expecting the final to be similarly fair). The papers were actually quite fun to write because we could choose to write about any translations, parallels, and commentaries we thought were most intriguing, i.e. there was a lot of free rein. The group activities, like the in-class art project, were great. I enjoyed the guest lecturer as well."

He elucidated a lot of thoughts I had coming in when I briefly read about 12 cantos. He forced us to grapple with many dimensions of Dante's poem and challenged my many preconceived notions on love, free will, the existence of a soul, and the role of mentorship within life.

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering. This coupled with an acute sense of self-awareness makes it hard to hate an exiled 14th century Italian man's charisma."

The Masnavi contains a reference in the back that is especially important to look up, since Rumi makes many metaphors and references that those not familiar with aspects of the Islamic faith are likely to miss. Attar is more comprehensible but he is by nature a poet, and so should also be read in this way.Read the texts very carefully."

I loved studying these historic texts and secondary sources with students outside of my own program, which allowed for new insights and understandings that have shaped the way I approach work in my home discipline. Dr. Martin created a lot of pathways for us to engage with the material, and I appreciated the weekly message board assignment as it allowed for me to engage my classmates and begin a dialogue even before I entered the classroom. This was especially meaningful for a weekly seminar where I only see my classmates once a week, and want to make the most of the time together. Dr. Martin did a great job lightly facilitating the class, but otherwise emphasizing a student-led discussion of the materials. He never discouraged us from pressing a topic or conversation further, even if it didn't directly address the overall seminar topic, and these conversations always ended up being very rich and linking us back to the ideas and concerns that make us interested in studying Columbus in the first place."

Please describe three specific things you learned.",This has got to be the most interesting class I've ever taken. It was very inteluctally stimulating and I've learned so much. Learning about the three different major monotheistic religions is learning three specific things in and of themselves. Learning about religion in a historical context is one of the most interesting things to learn and I've learned to shift my thinking from a theological prespective to a historical critical one. It has helped develop the way that I think about religion in a theological context and also has just given me a different viewpoint on history in general because religion has such a pivitol role in history.

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.
