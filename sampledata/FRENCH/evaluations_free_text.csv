The problem with so much work is that it made it difficult to fully engage with everything, and that forced me to put grammar on the back-burner. For a class that is supposed to be the refinement of grammar, I felt that we spent so much time on film and the other works that I wasn't able to develop my actual french grammar nuance how I would have liked. There is so much time to analyze complex aspects of french media and culture in the 300's, so I wish that this class would have been structured in a way that would allow me to give more energy and time to learning French grammar and nuance. I'm not saying to remove the analysis of french works, because I understand this course is preparing us to be able to analyse them, but there are just too many works, and too long of reflections. I understand language takes a lot of work, but this class is extremely stressful to balance within a Duke schedule if you truly engage with all the material; reducing the workload would make students so much happier, engaged, and allow them to learn more."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",Professor Choffart encouraged us to share and gave is the space and time to think through our statements. In past lower level french classes I have been scared to share due to fear of making a mistake and the reaction from past professors. Professor Choffart creates a positive and comfortable environment so that you feel able to share in whatever way you can. I think this is the most important thing in a foreign language class. If you are scared to practice you won't get better!

My class was only 7 people in total and because of that small environment, our discussion were active and Germain was a great facilitator of them. He listens. He validates our responses. He gives excellent feedback on writing assignments and publishes so many resources for us. The required Boomalang conversations were also very enriching."

I think that the level of work that we engaged in was very low and the level of French in the class was much lower than I had hoped for expectational-wise going into a course at this level. It felt much more reminiscent of a lower level course.

Comparing this to the 303 course that many people take as their introduction into 300 level courses, this is definitely the one to take if you're looking for less work.

As a side note, I happened to take this class at the same time as I was taking AAAS 380: France and Africa, taught by Stephen Smith, and these two classes complemented each other SUPER well--I would definitely recommend the combination."

- the class had different sections that we dived into as the semester went along, but it was such in a way that connected and previous classes would have laid fundamentals of some topics which made it even more interesting
- the flow of the course was interesting because the first part was more of the the way the French society is built or its fundamentals and the last ones were more of how it's applied and the challenges in its application, which made the materials even more meaningful
-It would be best to keep the sources being excerpts of different interesting videos/ debates/ news articles because it gave a whole range of interesting facts to know rather than reading a long reading talking about a particular thing"

- I didn't understand a lot of the brutalities that happened during Colonial France, especially from the authentic perspective of the victims.

One being the overarching conventional history, while the other documents everyday life for those who are not involved in surface level history, which probably affected more people. This was something that I referenced throughout this course as well as other courses. 
2.  Drawing Parallel
- Prof pointed out lots of parallels throughout the books we studied. How different subjects in the book act as metaphors for other things. 
3. Philosophy
- prof drew ideas from philosophers that supplemented the course"

From something as simple as making the distinction between ""réfugié(e)"" to ""demandeur d'asile"" at the beginning of the course to now being able to formulate literary and experiential analyses on different genres of works, I have gained the knowledge and more in-depth understanding of the refugee crises and experiences in different time periods as well as different parts of the world. 
2) Ways of thinking - This course has allowed me to exercise critical and evaluative thinking by considering different perspectives towards similar events portrayed by different works and different artists or authors and how the differences can affect the way the audience perceives a given experience. 
3) Skills (language) - my general level of the French language has certainly also improved since I was encouraged to speak in class, which improved my French speaking skills, and there are many writing practices and that enhanced my French writing level."

It's a testament to Professor Reisinger's skill that, despite differing opinions, everyone maintained a great deal of respect for each other and for her. Her kindness and thoughtfulness in guiding these discussions were truly appreciated.Additionally, the diverse range of readings she selected were thought-provoking and contributed significantly to the richness of our discussions.

These questions weren't just academic; they challenged us to consider broader perspectives and underlying themes in our studies.Another aspect that greatly contributed to the intellectual stimulation of the class was the context provided for each piece of material we consumed. Understanding the background and nuances of each work enriched our discussions and allowed us to engage with the content on a much deeper level.Moreover, the diversity of our course materials (in terms of periods, places, mediums, and content) was remarkable. From readings to assigned films, each piece was carefully chosen to complement and underscore the message that the migrant experience is far from singular. This variety not only kept the course dynamic and interesting but also broadened our understanding of the subject matter in a way that a more uniform set of materials could not.In short, the course was intellectually stimulating as it was. The diverse materials, along with Professor Reisinger's thought-provoking questions and insightful context, created a rich, multifaceted learning experience."

It is an opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to real-world situations, making a tangible impact in the community. This experience not only deepens your understanding of the course content but also imparts important life lessons in empathy, responsibility, and community involvement.Additionally, this course provides a deeper understanding of Durham's dynamics, allowing you to form connections and gain insights into the community in ways that might not have been previously apparent. It is an enlightening experience that broadens your perspective and fosters a sense of belonging to something greater than the university environment.Therefore, if you are prepared for a course that challenges you academically while offering meaningful community engagement, this course is an excellent choice. You will gain not just knowledge, but also invaluable experiences and connections."

I have been able to develop more nuanced analytical thinking skills in the realm of French history which, in turn, has deepened my appreciation for the main figures associated with that history."

She was extremely understanding if we needed help knowing a word in french, for example, and never made us feel as though we were being judged for our answers but instead fostered an environment of risk taking and exploration. I would recommend keeping the method of watching films at home and discussing them in class, as I felt this was the best use of class time. I also think having articles that related to the films was a good strategy for further engagement- but I would alternate between these always being in French or not, as it can get a bit overwhelming at times to read a 20+ page academic article in French."
