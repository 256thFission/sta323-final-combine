Before choosing the class, it's a good idea to review the publicly available course materials. If the difficulty seems too high, you can consider choosing another course. It's important to prepare in advance; otherwise, it might be hard to follow the class. I consider that the most important aspect of the course is understanding the logic behind various machine learning algorithms. If you get stuck with mathematical derivations, don't worry—feel free to ask the TA for help.
As for the assignments, they are challenging, so it's best to start each one early. However, the grading is quite fair. If you encounter any problems, you can always consult the TA, as they are very helpful. The project offers a lot of flexibility and is quite interesting. It allows you to practice the entire machine learning and data analysis workflow, which is a great opportunity to develop those skills.
Additionally, this course focuses a lot on traditional algorithms. If you’re expecting to learn about deep learning applications like computer vision or natural language processing, then this might not be the course you're looking for."

We almost exclusively focused on everything algebraically instead of looking at things conceptually. A non-insignificant amount of the class felt disorganized. Some homework problems asked for things we hadn't learned and had to be explained via email or removed from the psets, and the professor would make mistakes when explaining things sometimes that confused me until a student corrected her. I think I would've preferred more detailed lecture notes, and the lectures provide additive notes that supplemented the material, instead of the lecture handwritten notes being required to understand the material, as the handwritten notes were not super organized."

Also, the textbook is very helpful if you feel you need to fill in some gaps in your understanding or get some extra practice on a particular topic (I found the textbook practice to be extremely helpful for the first exam; there's a ton of good practice on the binomial distribution).

By the last week the TAs weren't even sure how to solve a significant portion of the HW problems.

The content wasn't very difficult, considering I have already taken Math 353 last semester and completed all math requirements for my major, however, his instruction was super difficult to follow. He had terrible hand-writing, which could be easily fixed by writing slower (but he did not care to write slower even though he would get asked what he wrote about 5 times a lecture). When asked a question he does a terrible job addressing it, and then asks the student, ""fair enough?"" and the student is obliged to say yes because it would be rude to say no. Often, I would ask a question, and his answer was so confusing that I didn't even know what question to ask as a follow-up, so when he asked me, ""fair enough?"" then I would have to say ""yes"", even though it was super unhelpful. He also frequently makes mistakes in his work, is inconsistent with his variables, does not define what he is instructing  is extremely disorganized. He is definitely smart, but he should not be teaching at the college level and should be put under review. It's personally frustrating to be paying all this money to have to deal with this type of instructor."

The content wasn't very difficult, considering I have already taken Math 353 last semester and completed all math requirements for my major, however, his instruction was super difficult to follow. He had terrible hand-writing, which could be easily fixed by writing slower (but he did not care to write slower even though he would get asked what he wrote about 5 times a lecture). When asked a question he does a terrible job addressing it, and then asks the student, ""fair enough?"" and the student is obliged to say yes because it would be rude to say no. Often, I would ask a question, and his answer was so confusing that I didn't even know what question to ask as a follow-up, so when he asked me, ""fair enough?"" then I would have to say ""yes"", even though it was super unhelpful. He also frequently makes mistakes in his work, is inconsistent with his variables, does not define what he is instructing  is extremely disorganized. He is definitely smart, but he should not be teaching at the college level and should be put under review. It's personally frustrating to be paying all this money to have to deal with this type of instructor."

She’s nice but too new. I’m pretty sure this was her first semester teaching it. She cannot teach that well (explaining complicated concepts clearly). The pacing of the class was terrible. She was going way too fast at the beginning of the semester and then the majority of the class bombed the first midterm (mean and median < 70). Afterwards, she decided to slow down the pace which helped, but then we were significantly behind the other sections. Because of this, we will not cover all the material initially on the syllabus. The only good thing is that the final will replace your lower midterm (however, this was the rule for all the sections independent of prof)."

At the start of class, Prof Jones would take questions. I found that this was really useful since I would sometimes have questions about the homework or content that came up as I was working on the homework or once I'd had some time to digest the content. I couldn't make office hours, so having a chance to ask questions at the start of class gave me reassurance that I could get some help. I like that we had practice problems before midterms and finals, and homework was generally a reasonable length.

One, speak louder and more confidently--I feel she's somewhat not so confident about her accent but the truth is no one gives a damn about accent as long as you go through things clearly; Two, walk around the class a bit more and talk to us. All in all, it all boils down to: we all can learn perfectly well by reading her notes, and that proves she put in tremendous work in prepping for class, and that should give her unparalleled confidence in speaking. She needs that. But I'll cut some slack coz she's still a new teacher in a different country, and as an international student, I perfectly empathize with that."

I recommend taking it if you were comfortable with 221, because the proofs are even harder than those in 221. It will surely prepare you for 400- or 500- level courses as a transition, and also give you a solid foundation for probability.

In particular, the model of first motivating the student by presenting an example, building intuition through a visualisation or analogy, and finally tying everything together with a concise and formal proof was a fantastic way of both building intuition in the students and guaranteeing that the concepts were being understood. The problem sets were engaging with a wide variety of problems from different disciplines, and professor Nolen was very accessible outside of class to help clear up any doubts.

Lastly, he emphasizes his office hours, and every time I went he was able to answer my questions very effectively. This is a great addition to the course.

While this course is geared towards math majors, you don't have to be one to take the course. In fact, I found out from others that certain concepts covered in this course (especially the deep exploration into Markov Chains) will prepare me well for other statistics courses I have to take down the line, especially STA 360.

I think I got a lot more familiar with probability as a language, and learned of more rigorous ways to solve state-based problems. I don't think I fully got all of the infinite chaining types of problems, but I liked some of the coding question at the beginning. For example, I learned you could simulate a steady state by just taking a large power of a matrix. I think as a whole I just got more comfortable with distributions and probability, and this was especially useful for me since I hadn't taken a probability course before this."

Being addressed by name as soon as I walked into a 100+ person lecture made me feel more comfortable asking questions or speaking during class, as I felt less like a random face in the crowd. He also was very good at noticing when the class was engaged or when we needed a break, and was not afraid to have a calm, unrelated discussion to give everyone a break if the class felt disengaged
The structure of the course, with labs directly going along with what we learned in class, was also nice and promoted deeper understanding of the statistical concepts we used. I really enjoyed the broad structure of starting with verbal understanding, moving on to visual understanding, and finally learning to use similar ideas in code. TA's were very approachable during and outside of lab sections, and I enjoyed having a page through which we could virtually ask questions."

I really only took this course because it was required for my major but it has been one of the most fun, interesting, and useful courses I've taken at Duke. Course work in totally manageable and you can complete the majority of most labs (which is the major homework component) in lab section. I also went into this class with little knowledge of coding but Professor Zito and the TAs are fantastic at explaining and helping everyone regardless of where they are in their programming journey."

So if you're getting that same message from your friends, I'd encourage you to consider stats 101. It was not a hard class overall, and I learned a lot about a subject I'd been pretty actively avoiding and feeling overwhelmed about."

The labs are not necessarily hard, but they will probably take you a lot longer than you think and you may run into technological issues.
Even though attendance for both lab sections and class is optional, I would definitely recommend attending both. The class provides important background/understanding for the content you will need on the lab, and the TA's are super helpful for understanding the lab fully and may even talk the class through trickier bits of code, or occasionally introduce/explain certain aspects of code."

By engaging properly, I also actually felt prepared going into my mid-terms, and this sense of self-efficacy was empowering.

Most of you will take this because you are forced to for your major and just know upperclassmen aren't lying when they say this class is the worst. Labs take a significant amount of your time so I recommend taking this class if you have a lighter course load one semester. Content isn't necessarily hard to grasp but lecture style and boring datasets make it hard to apply. The tests also don't really align with what you've learned and the class as a whole benefits those with a strong stats background and Chat 4.0. Start take-home midterms the second they come out because they take hours. Good luck! It's been my least favorite class at Duke and I didn't even learn enough to apply R to my future career.

This is so much frustrating work for social science/humanities majors so really avoid it if you can. Dr. Zito is great but this class is so awful I hated it. If you are looking to fulfill a QS chose another class. TAs often don't know what they are talking about. Learning to code was interesting but the multiple choice section of the exams were always very difficult as you learn more about coding itself in the class rather than a lot of logic behind it.

The TAs were also really good, and I appreciated how many of them were affiliated with this class because it meant that there were SO many people to turn to with questions. I really appreciated the Application Exercises that we completed in class because they helped me stay engaged with the content by putting things into practice right away. These resources were super helpful to reference when completing the Homework or Exam assignments. I thought that the Homeworks were great; they helped us apply our learning in slightly new contexts but mainly just helped us recap the concepts we learned. The Exams served as a really useful test of our knowledge and ability to apply these concepts in contexts that were more difficult to understand. I think all of these components should be kept! I also think one more homework could be added."

I found it particularly helpful how lectures would explain the concept more generally, then apply an example and then revisit the big picture idea. I found this structure to really helpful for grasping new topics, particularly as this is an accelerated summer class. I also really liked the course website that stood outside of Canvas. Office hours were also extremely helpful, I'd like to thank the instructors for (collaboratively) providing office hours every single day of the week. The fact that the office hours varied in location and time was also helpful, especially as most students taking a summer class also had research or internship hours. In that respect, the instructors could not have been more supportive - even offering time outside of office hours to look over midterm grades or work through projects and lab questions students weren't confident with."

I've tried to take this class in previous semesters under different instructors, and the method of teaching was nowhere near as concise or effective. I'm pretty sure half the class dropped the class before the add/drop period was over (I know I sure did). Under Marie, instruction was exceedingly well-paced and organized, which is CRAZY because she only had 6 weeks to teach us the same amount of material that my previous instructor had 12 weeks for. The resources for aid in this class were abundant and effective; online notes, office hours everyday (both in person and virtual), quick feedback on assignments and answer keys to class lessons, google forms to evaluate class morale + status + questions, and flexibility in office hours to accommodate for extra help should you need it. Truly, the support, attention to detail, plethora of resources, and timeliness of all matters in this class made the environment more than welcoming and engaging, and facilitated my learning tenfold."

You could tell she genuinely loved what she taught because her enthusiasm was infectious. Even when she was explaining the most confusing concepts, she had this way of breaking things down that made you think, ""Oh, that actually makes sense.""
Her office door was always open, literally and figuratively. I remember stopping by during her office hours feeling completely lost about an assignment, and she'd sit with me until I finally got it—no rushing, no judgment, just patience. She was often there before I arrived and still there when I left, which said everything about how much she cared.
But what I'll remember most is how she treated each of us like we had something valuable to contribute. She didn't just want us to memorize information and spit it back out. She pushed us to think for ourselves and to grow as students!"

2. How to use R and R Studio—as a Psychology & Public Policy major super interested in research, learning how to compute statistics is super important & applicable
3. How to study effectively—with STA 199, I tried my very best to attend every lecture and lab, to be present & engage by asking clarifying questions, and so on, and this ended up being the smoothest STEM class experience I’ve had at Duke (I’ve previously struggled with COMPSCI 101 & 201). By engaging properly, I also actually felt prepared going into my mid-terms, and this sense of self-efficacy was empowering. A lot of this was due to the welcoming class environment Dr. Zito constructed, as well as how digestible he made the lecture content (which I didn’t experience in COMPSCI 101 & 201—for those classes, it felt like we were going too fast)"

Most of you will take this because you are forced to for your major and just know upperclassmen aren't lying when they say this class is the worst. Labs take a significant amount of your time so I recommend taking this class if you have a lighter course load one semester. Content isn't necessarily hard to grasp but lecture style and boring datasets make it hard to apply. The tests also don't really align with what you've learned and the class as a whole benefits those with a strong stats background and Chat 4.0. Start take-home midterms the second they come out because they take hours. Good luck! It's been my least favorite class at Duke and I didn't even learn enough to apply R to my future career.

This is so much frustrating work for social science/humanities majors so really avoid it if you can. Dr. Zito is great but this class is so awful I hated it. If you are looking to fulfill a QS chose another class. TAs often don't know what they are talking about. Learning to code was interesting but the multiple choice section of the exams were always very difficult as you learn more about coding itself in the class rather than a lot of logic behind it.

Dr. Tackett made a concerted effort to apply what we learn to situations outside of our dataset (i.e. the reproducibility segment on one of the HWs), but much of what we learned was conceptual and quantitative, which was mostly the goal of the course. In this, I think the course was successful."

Regardless, Dr. Tackett is great, concise, knowledgeable, and considerate. The workload is pretty manageable and you walk out of the class having done a final group project on any topic of your choice. I honestly find that you learn more about machine learning type stuff (very basics of the importance of testing/training models etc.) than you would in other CS 200 level classes, which I think is really important to know nowadays. And it's of course applicable to any programming language beyond R. Take this class!!! Even if you are not a stats major!!! You will learn so much."

If you are looking for a QS credit, you might be better off looking somewhere else unless you know that a deep-dive into different regression models is going to be useful to you later on. If you do fall into the latter category, take this course! Even though the assignments sometimes lack clarity and fairness in grading towards the student body in general, you will still learn a lot about regression analysis."

With exams in person, and therefore exam averages in the 70s (with no curve), I would discourage non-STA majors from taking this class.

It was a lecture, so the repetitive nature of the class is expected. The labs were nice, but I wasn't really a fan of doing labs together and getting graded together. You have to force yourself to rely on the application of others unless you want to do MORE than your share and revise everyone's work before submission (this defeats the purpose of group work in a sense). I was often disappointed by the grades I got because of other students' answers to questions. You end up having to split the work because it is not reasonable to discuss every question and walk through every step together to get things done promptly during lab time - then it is not fair if one student has to work outside of lab too. The group labs are what is bringing my grade down and not even the questions I answered."

We almost exclusively focused on everything algebraically instead of looking at things conceptually. A non-insignificant amount of the class felt disorganized. Some homework problems asked for things we hadn't learned and had to be explained via email or removed from the psets, and the professor would make mistakes when explaining things sometimes that confused me until a student corrected her. I think I would've preferred more detailed lecture notes, and the lectures provide additive notes that supplemented the material, instead of the lecture handwritten notes being required to understand the material, as the handwritten notes were not super organized."

Also, the textbook is very helpful if you feel you need to fill in some gaps in your understanding or get some extra practice on a particular topic (I found the textbook practice to be extremely helpful for the first exam; there's a ton of good practice on the binomial distribution). It's also good if you want to understand where a formula is coming from. And come to class :)"

I needed 1/4 of a page for my first midterm notesheet, 1 full page for my second midterm notesheet (2 weeks later), and 2 pages for my final exam notesheet (1 week after second midterm). By the last week the TAs weren't even sure how to solve a significant portion of the HW problems. Also go to office hours and get the TAs to show you all the HW answers because the HW questions are on average far harder than the test questions, especially since on the HWs you are applying new content learned in class for the first time."

He is so understanding about extensions for homeworks, which was really nice to see since some professors don't recognize that life can get tough for students, especially more than once in a given semester. I think the in class questions with the graded participation are fun to do and keep students engaged even though it is pretty early in the morning. The exams are pretty fair and he provides lots of practice questions. he's also very available as he hosts office hours and will schedule other meeting times if that doesn't work for you."

He had terrible hand-writing, which could be easily fixed by writing slower (but he did not care to write slower even though he would get asked what he wrote about 5 times a lecture). When asked a question he does a terrible job addressing it, and then asks the student, ""fair enough?"" and the student is obliged to say yes because it would be rude to say no. Often, I would ask a question, and his answer was so confusing that I didn't even know what question to ask as a follow-up, so when he asked me, ""fair enough?"" then I would have to say ""yes"", even though it was super unhelpful. He also frequently makes mistakes in his work, is inconsistent with his variables, does not define what he is instructing  is extremely disorganized.

The content wasn't very difficult, considering I have already taken Math 353 last semester and completed all math requirements for my major, however, his instruction was super difficult to follow. He had terrible hand-writing, which could be easily fixed by writing slower (but he did not care to write slower even though he would get asked what he wrote about 5 times a lecture). When asked a question he does a terrible job addressing it, and then asks the student, ""fair enough?"" and the student is obliged to say yes because it would be rude to say no. Often, I would ask a question, and his answer was so confusing that I didn't even know what question to ask as a follow-up, so when he asked me, ""fair enough?"" then I would have to say ""yes"", even though it was super unhelpful. He also frequently makes mistakes in his work, is inconsistent with his variables, does not define what he is instructing  is extremely disorganized. He is definitely smart, but he should not be teaching at the college level and should be put under review. It's personally frustrating to be paying all this money to have to deal with this type of instructor."

She was going way too fast at the beginning of the semester and then the majority of the class bombed the first midterm (mean and median < 70). Afterwards, she decided to slow down the pace which helped, but then we were significantly behind the other sections. Because of this, we will not cover all the material initially on the syllabus.

I couldn't make office hours, so having a chance to ask questions at the start of class gave me reassurance that I could get some help.

I recommend taking it if you were comfortable with 221, because the proofs are even harder than those in 221. It will surely prepare you for 400- or 500- level courses as a transition, and also give you a solid foundation for probability.

All of the concepts build on each other which forces you to really engage with every lecture and make sure you stay on top of things. The class was very challenging - probably one of the most difficult I've taken - but now that I am almost done with it I can see how much I have learned and improved since August.

Lectures were dry and unfocussed to the point where I didn't even bother paying attention sometimes because I knew the professor was teaching us an overly simplified version of what we were expected to know. The homework also bordered on torture because I would spend maybe 1 hour on Bayesian statistic and then another 9+ hours doing algebra. I understand that algebra is an important part of statistics but sometimes the homework problems felt like they were missing the forest for the trees. Bayesian statistics is the forest and algebra is the trees.I would also say almost no concepts in the class struck the boundary well between applied and theoretical. I personally felt like I didn't have the theoretical justification for the applied problems we did (often on the homework or toy examples in class) and I didn't understand how some of the more theoretical concepts (metropolis Hastings, gibbs sampling, etc) were actually applicable.Overall, I would recommend that the statistics department reorganize its major structure so that everyone comes into stat 360 with a really strong core in probability theory and in R coding so that the class can spend less time reteaching things (poorly for that matter) and spend more time building these new concepts."

It is easy to get caught up in working on the problem sets because they take lots of time, but it is also equally important to stay on top of the material. Start the problem sets early and work on a little at a time!!! Also, the textbook is helpful if there's a concept where the explanation from lecture doesn't quite stick with you, or if you want a more detailed explanation. My last thing would be to persevere! The material is really tough and you'll probably do poorly on a homework or exam at some point, but it's all part of the process of learning new things. If you dedicate enough time, things will start to make more sense."

He may be a nice human being but he is not a good professor for this class. He is is so set in his ways that he refuses to give students the tools they need to learn. I know from my own experiences as well as talking to peers in the class that the TAs are saving our butts in this class because they filter the things that Dr. Fisher says into what is actually useful.
We had one guest lecture from Dr. Hoff when Dr. Fisher took a day off for paternity leave and it was amazing how much clearer everything was. 
Stat 360 could be an incredibly useful and interesting class if it was just better motivated. I was deciding between majoring and statistics and math but this class made me decide on the math major.So far, this is the only class at Duke where I consistently left lectures, office hours, or time spend working on the homework angry. Not frustrated or discouraged, but angry because it felt like I was being asked to something outside of my capabilities and then when I went to get help on it (and I went to 2-3 office hours sessions a week) the professor just wouldn't be willing to help me. I am fine with struggling in school, but faculties job is to help their students when they're struggling and I never felt like Dr. Fisher actually took time to listen to what his students needed or make necessary changes to his teaching style and office hours structure to meet students where they are."

In fact, at many points in the semester, I was so stressed by this course that I considered changing my major just so I could drop the class. The two saving graces that kept me in the course were 1) I’d have taken a minor in statistics, and this class is required by the minor as well, and 2) I couldn’t graduate on time with a major change this late in my college career. If this course is required for a student, I’d take it alongside only the easiest possible courses, and even then, inform your friends and family that you won’t be available until the semester closes. I am an alternative student in that I am a student veteran with a wife and home, and when family health problems made me a full-time caretaker of my elderly father, I had to stop going to one of my courses lectures entirely to make time to do the problem sets for this course. Simply put, this course will dominate the life of a student taking it, at likely impact their performance in their other courses as well. It should be avoided, even in the face of serious curiosity for the subject, unless explicitly required. I’d advise buying the textbook and working through it at your own pace over a summer for the curious. I’ll probably do the same this summer, so I can do some real learning without the fire hose of homework and exam pressure."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Dr. Fisher made the class a very open place for learning. By allowing the classroom to be a place to ask questions, he ensured students could ask questions. He was always a kind human being that made sure students could say they didn't understand what was going on. I think the homeworks were challenging, but they forced me to understand some of the procedures necessary for this class like deriving full conditionals and practicing MCMC code.  The recorded lectures were extremely helpful. Sometimes it takes a few times to hear something and get it but having the opportunity to review the content presented in class is very useful. In addition, I found labs helpful because they presented students with another instructor who was able to explain ideas in a different way and provided practice with some of the more abstract ideas in class. Just like being able to review materials was helpful, hearing two different people (1. prof, 2. lab instructor) talk about the same thing helped students adopt the concept. In the future, I'd keep the labs because I found them helpful. Dr. Fisher was never afraid to pause in class to answer a student's question, even if it meant diverging from the original plan. I really appreciate this. As someone with different neurology than most people, I found it was easier to focus because I knew I could ask questions at any point and he would do his best to answer them.  Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that he tried to incorporate active learning nn the class so students could collaborate with one another and try to ask questions about ideas before information was presented to us. This set us up to think critically about some of the class ideas."

I liked that homework problems and class examples often integrated real-world applications, such as the water on Mars class. I like that lab sections were usually an extension of lecture topics, so lab gave me a chance to hear about topics again from a different perspective.

If you put in the work in terms of studying weekly the past chapters and utilize Professor Hoff as a resource, you can definitely do well, but it will take a lot of work. I would recommend trying to take this class when your other classes aren't as demanding of you since the homeworks are quite intense."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I can't stress enough how much I appreciated Professor Reeves's beginning of class summaries, intuitive explanations, and general organization and preparedness. Professor Reeves did an excellent job of motivating/contextualizing new topics, easing us into lectures with reviews of the previous lecture's content, and providing intuitive explanations for concepts that could easily become very heavy in math and notation. I think one of the most important parts of a good teacher's job is providing intuition and connecting the dots between different concepts. It's somewhat easier to develop a basic understanding of concepts by reading a textbook, but something that a textbook can't as fluidly provide is intuition and context. Professor Reeves was so good about pausing and breaking down theorems or new ideas in simple terms. Personally, I find it immensely beneficial to my understanding to hear concepts reduced to simple, even if a bit reductionist terms, before grappling with the full rigorous mathematical presentation of an idea.I also appreciate how organized Professor Reeves was. Homework was always posted on or before the date promised, giving me ample time to work on the assignment before the due date. Lecture notes were also clear, organized, and posted well ahead of the lecture date, allowing me to prepare for lectures and providing a great resource for me to refer to. These lecture notes clearly took time to prepare, so I really appreciate all the time that Professor Reeves dedicated to preparing lecture notes for us. The course followed the posted schedule, and any changes were announced in advance. Homework and exams are also highly representative of the content and examples covered in class.I also really enjoyed the LDOC lecture, where Professor Reeves introduced us to some applications and research topics related to what we learned in class. Overall, Professor Reeves did a fantastic job of presenting a well-organized, intelligent, thoughtful, and reasonable class. I think he really nailed the key points of what a good professor can provide that a textbook cannot. This approach also demonstrated the professor's ability to empathize with students, recognizing where content could be difficult to grasp for the first time and even acknowledging when a quick five minute break could lead to a more productive class."

He's patient, always willing to answer questions in class, and even encourages us to ask more during lectures. He's highly knowledgeable and approachable. Not only does he provide deeper insights into the lessons, but he's also eager to share his industry and academic expertise. His experience and expertise make his advice incredibly valuable. I truly enjoy my time in his class and find interacting with him to be a rewarding experience. He genuinely cares about his students and their success.Regarding the course components for future years, I believe keeping the lecture slides is beneficial. They offer a broad overview of various techniques and make it easy to compare and understand their pros and cons. While most lecture slides are well-written and clear (if you read them carefully), I find the second half of the slides more comprehensible and relatable. Dr. Banks has also employed various methods to test and support our understanding, including different types of homework.

The promotion of ChatGPT for class assignments didn't motivate me to actually do the work and learn the content. I understand that it is a valuable and increasingly widely used tool, but I do not think that using ChatGPT encourages learning."

STA-521L-001_Banks__David_Fall_2024.html,Fall 2024,STA-521L-001 : PREDICTIVE MODELING.STA-521L-001.,David Banks,4,What made this class stimulating or how could it be more intellectually stimulating if it wasn’t?,"The material itself has a lot of potential, and I like the concept of this class being less theoretical. I wish that in the future, this class can get changed again so that it covers maybe fewer things, but in a bit more depth. Or, fully lean into it being more practical and actually make it a high level overview kind of course, take out ALL the theory, and focus on our conceptual understanding, ability to explain the topics coherently to a less technical audience, and ability to put the models covered in class into practice. I had a classmate who mentioned an interesting idea, making the final project into a mock interview sort of thing. While it would be a lot harder, I think that's a really interesting direction to take the class, and keeps with the spirit of the changes made to it already. I know as an MSS student that our proseminar class kind of covered interview prep / career stuff, but just an idea haha.
If they really want to cater to the students who want to be data scientists, I think they should show us all the topics they have for this class, and then ask us what WE want to cover and what would be useful to us to understand, instead of speedrunning literally everything in the book. Also I think it would be easier on the instructor as well, because there were clearly certain areas he didn't understand as well, yet still tried to give lectures on. 
Also, the labs were basically just the TAs talking through an already filled out R Markdown file, so it was mostly just for participation, which I appreciated but also made it really easy to tune out and disengage from. I would've enjoyed it more if those labs felt a bit more interactive, and we got to do some hands on stuff related to what was covered in class."

It could be even more engaging by including more case studies or projects that reflect current industry practices.

He is also extremely helpful during office hours, where he walks us through the concepts, explains how to solve challenging parts of the homework, and sometimes discusses other research-related topics. The homework is a nice addition to the lectures, as it helped me work out specific details of what we learned in class. Apart from his ability to deliver the lectures, he struck me as a very caring professor because of the little details, such as remembering all of our names, asking us on the first day of class what we wanted to learn and how he could help us study better, encouraging discussion in class, combining writing and slides and moving deadlines when necessary. Additionally, the TAs were also very helpful during office hours. Overall, I'm grateful to study under the guidance of an amazing professor like him."

For instance, his class lectures seamlessly connect and complement one another, providing valuable guidance for students, whether they choose to delve into the textbook in detail or not.Moreover, Professor Li Ma is always open to questions in class and excels at explaining complex concepts. He explains the meaning of each term in a formula and provides insight into the effects of altering various components in the prior or the modeling on the posterior. He also discusses how excluding specific assumptions can lead to modifications in the final results.During office hours, he not only endeavors to answer students' questions comprehensively but also willingly discusses various aspects of research and industry. This provides us with valuable insights into current research and professional directions. Beyond his expertise, Professor Li Ma is understanding, personable, and adds humor to the class through appreciated jokes. Additionally, the support from both office hours and teaching assistants is highly commendable."

Even without a great statistical background, there is a lot you can get out of the course."

It gives you some time to fully understand the fundamentals of time series and a very good first glimps into more modern approaches. If you’re already familiar with TS, consider still talking the class, since, especially the later half will be venturing into recursive updating and modern approaches in TS-linked methods."

While I acknowledge the projects were designed with the ideas of challenging us to go above and beyond and make some contributions to open source that could add to our portfolio, the instructor provided very unclear guidelines and minimal help outside of class for those. For example, we received 0 feedback for project 1 draft submission (which was promised) and received 0 reply for tons of questions on ed during the spring break, during which many of us worked very hard to complete the projects and prepare the presentation. The grading and the judgment on the so called ""level of complexity"" seemed to be very subjective for me and did not account for the fact that many of us are new to Python and we received almost no feedback and help during the process.Some of the labs are valuable resources, and the TAs are generally helpful on them, but we still completed them and learned the material mostly with the help of ChatGPT. The lectures are generally disorganized and  did not really cover the coding and application aspects in detail, which are pretty detached from what we are doing in the labs. There are also too many lectures used on presentations and guest lectures, and I hardly ever felt this course has a focus on Python programming. The syllabus also kept changing during the semester right until almost the end of the term, which makes it very hard for us to know what to expect and plan accordingly."

Before choosing the class, it's a good idea to review the publicly available course materials. If the difficulty seems too high, you can consider choosing another course. It's important to prepare in advance; otherwise, it might be hard to follow the class. I consider that the most important aspect of the course is understanding the logic behind various machine learning algorithms. If you get stuck with mathematical derivations, don't worry—feel free to ask the TA for help.
As for the assignments, they are challenging, so it's best to start each one early. However, the grading is quite fair. If you encounter any problems, you can always consult the TA, as they are very helpful. The project offers a lot of flexibility and is quite interesting. It allows you to practice the entire machine learning and data analysis workflow, which is a great opportunity to develop those skills.
Additionally, this course focuses a lot on traditional algorithms. If you’re expecting to learn about deep learning applications like computer vision or natural language processing, then this might not be the course you're looking for."
