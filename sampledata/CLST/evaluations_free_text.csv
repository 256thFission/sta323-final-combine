Professor Ginsberg is knowledgeable, but I did not like her focus on less traditional perspectives in Rome, as I had hoped to get more of a classical history background on Rome through Constantine.

It's so much fun learning about Romans outside of successful battle campaigns or just through the lens of politics. The exploration of Roman culture at all tiers of social hierarchy made this class stand out from others because we deviated from the typical study of Roman culture which I feel is often limited in scope regarding the populations we study.

I prefer Confucianism's focus on ritual in dealing with loss.3. I've learnt to appreciate writing more.

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class.

The interest I and others would gain from lectures is often overshadowed by the confusion regarding deadlines and grading expectations. I know it is hard to coordinate a class with so many students and teachers, but sometimes assignment due dates feel rushed. I have heard such amazing things about this class and felt a little disappointed with how it actually went. The retreat was absolutely amazing, and I believe the TI program has the potential to keep that energy going the entire class."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

Leaves, daily questions, and discussion days were a great way of getting students to meaningfully engage with the material. I also felt that the lack of necessity for leaves to be completely polished pieces of work was an extremely helpful feature that should be included in more classes. Because class engagement was more about the process of forming ideas and processing the course material as opposed to producing results, heavy focus was put on actually enjoying and learning from the material, as opposed to cramming or absorbing it to get a good grade."

I liked that the readings were primary sources rather than just textbook readings, however I do think that just a little more emphasis on the facts of Greek history/the timeline would have made the class more intellectually stimulating, because while I feel like I did learn a lot in the class I don’t necessarily feel like I left with a clear understanding of the facts of Greek history."

But I did come to Duke to take classes that promoted intellectually rigorous environments.  Kate Morgan's class on Iron Age Phrygia and Lydia promoted the environment that I had been looking for.  While Kate Morgan is indisputably one of the rising stars in the study of ancient Anatolia and near East and has accumulated more hours in the trenches of Gordion than I have spent in the Perkins Library, she does not try to teach a version of ""Archaeological Methods"" or ""Phrygian Burnished Ware Typologies.""  She assigns readings and directs class discussion with an eye to how non archaeologists can wrangle not just with the material evidence from such a fascinating part of the world (e.g. she assigns ancient testimonia on Gordion and Sardis; I got my Homer and Herodotus fix), but how they can wrangle with larger questions of reconstructing the past.  Kate Morgan is as great a practitioner of Altertumswissenschaft as they come, juxtaposing context against text; destruction layer with destruction layer; history with historiography.  Her expectations for discussion and course participation are high; she is disappointed when they are not met (although she is much too considerate to say anything about it).  But in the end, she cultivates an enriching class atmosphere that makes me grateful that I came to Duke."

The topic of reception is one that I have always been interested in, but I have never had the framework to really understand it in this way. Our readings and case studies showed us how we could apply a critical lens to the interpretation of the past. Most importantly, we kept returning to the question of ""so what?"" Why does this matter and what's at stake with these topics? Learning how to dissect an example of classical reception and understand it more critically was a skill I will be practicing in my own work a lot going forward. If I had to identify three specific things that I learned, I would say that I learned how to ""read"" reception (how to understand what I was encountering and how to unpack it), I learned to ask why something matters, and I learned how to apply these concepts to my own work."

She clearly knows the material very well and is able to guide students towards getting the most knowledge out of it that they can. She also takes student input and feedback into account when creating and adjusting assignments. During each class meeting, there was always a schedule laying out what topics and texts we would be discussing that day, which was very helpful in organizing class sessions. Students had to complete one individual presentation on a topic of their choice, called a ""Cultural Critique Show and Tell,"" which was extremely helpful in learning to apply the material covered in class. Dr. Weiberg was also willing to meet with students to discuss assignments and potential research topics, and always provided valuable input in the form of ideas and scholarly resources during these meetings."

I think if it was stated more explicitly to not raise hands but just jump into a conversation, then things might be easier for students. Also, I liked working in small groups (especially when we were told to mix it up from our neighbors), and collaborative projects like the Nasher presentation and the Eurydice program notes were definitely exercises that I enjoyed!I always really appreciated that slides are posted each week because it lets me follow along and focus better.

If you are someone who studies the ancient world, the concepts we covered are essential to understand if you want to be a responsible scholar.

Also, take full advantage of his open office hours schedule- he is an incredibly intelligent man that has been able to answer so many questions and entertain so many discussions, both course-related and not."
