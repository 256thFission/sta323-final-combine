I learned about key fossil discoveries, like Australopithecus afarensis and Homo erectus, which helped me understand the branching nature of human evolution. I also gained experience using the scientific method to analyze fossil evidence and test hypotheses about early human behavior. One of the most interesting insights was learning how culture and biology interact—for example, how the development of tools and symbolic thought played a major role in shaping who we are today. This course changed how I think about human origins."

Other concepts, such as genetics and evolution, were some of which I found very interesting. Genetics was used to amplify agendas with the research done with it, and notifying all the good and bad things about studying genetics was insightful to learn. Evolution as well; learning how humans evolved to be who we are today was something I expected from this class, but the degree of depth we covered the content was very insightful and enlightening as well."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course asked some questions that necessitated I form my own opinion on the subject, rather than there being one clear answer. This sparked many outside-of-class conversations that I enjoyed. I learned about the primate family tree and how each species differs. I also learned about the evolution of the human race from our ape-like origins and how the species changed until now. I learned about energy consumption and use, and how much those two factors play on the makeup of a species."

The consistency was great! And despite the seemingly monotonous structure of the course, Dr. Pontzer managed to make every lesson engaging and fun for students. Even though he was teaching from a PowerPoint, Dr. Pontzer frequently involved students by asking questions, opening the floor up for discussions, or having us participate in some sort of interactive challenge to prove a point he was teaching about. Dr. Pontzer was always very clear about what to expect on the exams and I found all the exams to be fair…not too difficult but not too easy."

I wouldn't change pretty much anything, especially the essay assignments. I think the structure of the essay assignments was very fun, and a great way for me to make a new friend as well as get exposed to the research going on at Duke.

I do appreciate the expertise and help the professors are willing to offer, and I hope it doesn't sound like I don't. If I was able to know my grade in the class also, I would be able to study appropriately. There are in-class checks during the quizzes, but I don't know how they all even out when it comes to my final grade, which makes it hard to prioritize what I should study when preparing for subsequent exams."

Be ready to put a lot of time in, and I suggest trying to study ahead when possible (even if you are caught up), because you will thank yourself when it comes time for a quiz or exam. Ideally, you should study and review content a little bit every single day. If you need anatomy and physiology as a pre-requisite for grad school, I think that class would be fine in most cases, but check with the grad program.

I was never the biggest fan of group studying before anatomy, but talking things out and hearing the ways in which your classmates understand things could help you see things differently and help you develop a deeper understanding of the material. I would also say be active in your studying. Whether that means practicing active recall techniques or drawing things out, it is very hard to remember all there is to know about anatomy if you merely passively engage with the content. So try your best to engage as much as you can with all the material in ways that are active and helpful for you."

We also used excel to analyze our data—I had not used excel before this class but I am now much more comfortable using it because Dr. Digby walks you through the process. Our TA, Erika, was also very helpful if we needed extra help with our data and trying to sort it properly.
