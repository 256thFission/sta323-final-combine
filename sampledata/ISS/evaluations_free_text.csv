Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

The integration of critical theory with hands-on design work created a unique space to experiment and question—something I haven’t experienced in other courses. The encouragement to situate our own identities and research within our mapping projects made the work personally meaningful and conceptually rich.What made the course especially engaging was the freedom to pursue a self-directed final project.

To make the class even more intellectually stimulating, it could be helpful to look at a broader range of real-world experimental interfaces together as a class. While we were encouraged to explore, some of the presentations—both mine and others—started to feel a bit repetitive and leaned heavily toward apps and consumer products. It would’ve been exciting to get more exposure to how different interface concepts are being applied in fields like art, tech, and research. Professor Seaman was also knowledgeable & knew a lot of different interfaces/works/research relevant to our presentation/project topics off the top of his head; it might have been more engaging to learn directly from some examples/insights alongside student presentations."

I would propose that students work towards making an actual website at the end of the project instead of making a slideshow presentation as we did not implement any skills of interface design. This class is more accurately described as a discussion class since there was a lack of knowledge being applied. Each week’s class was the same with presentations taking the entire period, so I would get rid of these a commit to having an open discussion about specific principles and techniques each class to add direction."

I commonly found myself presenting on topics that I found interesting, and both the professor and my colleagues would recommend me new topics to explore. The course also gives the students a lot of freedom in the topics they explore, so I was able to learn a lot of knowledge around topics that I wouldn't think of researching myself, but find interesting as they pertain to the body as an electrochemical computer. The three things I learned then are the ability to make connections between topics, the importance of ethics in artificial intelligence, and being able to think of humans from an artificial intelligence's point of view."

To make the class even more intellectually stimulating, it could be helpful to look at a broader range of real-world experimental interfaces together as a class.

I would propose that students work towards making an actual website at the end of the project instead of making a slideshow presentation as we did not implement any skills of interface design.

 I learned how to reinterpret failure not as a setback, but as a meaningful part of the creative and innovation process. The course helped me understand that failure is often where the most valuable insights come from.
 I developed skills in personal reflection through writing and discussion which allowed me to better process my experiences and view them through emotional and intellectual lenses.

Triplett is so sweet and the class is so sooooooo so good. Not a lot of academic pressure on the grades but you learn a TON every week, a perfect combo.

The professor clearly has deep knowledge of the subject, but I often felt there were limited opportunities to learn directly from his expertise. The course leaned heavily on student presentations, which at times led to uneven coverage of the material. Based on my experience in other seminars, dividing class time more evenly—half instructor-led and half student-led—has proven to be a more effective and enriching structure.

The in person discussions were not stimulating and felt serving to the two students familiar with the material and the professor only.

That kind of engagement with our object lessons would have been beneficial early on to make sure our thinking was on the right track.

Having an outside of class activity to apply our knowledge to was very useful and fun. It could be nice to do something like that all together as a class. 
-The object lessons were stimulating at the beginning of the semester and then became a bit redundant. If there was some sort of a shift in direction with the object lessons about halfway through the semester, it could make students more engaged with them. This could be suggesting a theme to pull an object from, or connecting readings to an object that was already posted about, etc.
-Having explicit space to discuss object lessons in class would have been helpful."

Professor Triplett structured the course in a way that balanced technical skill-building in map-making with deep conceptual inquiry into spatial narratives and visual storytelling. I particularly appreciated the open-ended nature of the assignments, which allowed me to align course projects with my dissertation interests on historical land use and environmental change.  The class discussions and weekly readings provided a strong theoretical foundation that challenged me to think more deeply about what maps represent—and what they omit. The feedback sessions, especially peer critiques and one-on-one check-ins, were extremely valuable for refining both the design and intent behind my maps.One of the most effective components I would recommend keeping is the scaffolded structure of the final project. It was incredibly helpful to break the process into stages (proposal, moodboard, draft, etc.), which made the final creative deliverable feel achievable and purposeful. I also found the integration of both analog and digital cartographic techniques to be pedagogically rich, and I’d encourage maintaining that blend in future iterations of the course."

The integration of critical theory with hands-on design work created a unique space to experiment and question—something I haven’t experienced in other courses. The encouragement to situate our own identities and research within our mapping projects made the work personally meaningful and conceptually rich.What made the course especially engaging was the freedom to pursue a self-directed final project.

There were some people in our class that did not participate during Critique so I did not have an urge to offer them feedback. I believe Critique should be a reciprocal experience and I strongly encourage that to be enforced.
-Changing settings from the classroom to outside to the film room helped keep the class stimulating. 
-The technical demos during class were incredibly helpful."

Three specific things I learned were:
 I learned how to reinterpret failure not as a setback, but as a meaningful part of the creative and innovation process. The course helped me understand that failure is often where the most valuable insights come from.
 I developed skills in personal reflection through writing and discussion which allowed me to better process my experiences and view them through emotional and intellectual lenses.
 The course encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone and take creative and intellectual risks without fear of being ""wrong."" That shift in thinking was incredibly freeing and helped me grow more confident in uncertain situations."
