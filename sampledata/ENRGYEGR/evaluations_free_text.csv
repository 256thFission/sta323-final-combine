Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned more about the field of power electronics, specifically with circuit analysis. One thing I learned was how to analyze circuits in steady state analysis. Going off of this, we also covered several different types of converters and their basic functions. Lastly, we covered AC circuits by gaining an understanding of how they differ from DC circuits and how they can be analyzed using different methods. Overall, although the course is designed to teach power electronics, by nature of the topic, there is a review of other electronics theories (with capacitors, inductors, power sources, etc)."

I think the slides accompany the book so the only problem with that is if there's more context that students need to conceptualize, they only have one primary source as the slides are synopsis of the book rather than the professor's version. I loved the addition of the lab component where we got to build a converter and analyze it. Seeing the waveforms follow what should be expected by the math was very cool and working with physical component, power supplies, and oscilloscopes was great for me because I haven't in years!"
