Please describe three specific things you learned.","This was a remarkably engaging and thought-provoking class. I had a chance to improve my Greek comprehension skills and was considerably more comfortably with sight reading in Greek by the end of semester. I also got to practice my Greek composition and grammar and managed to improve my language competence overall.
But what made this class so stimulating was its content: Greek novel and Lucian are very engaging subjects and as we covered the course materials numerous relevant and interesting themes came up. We discussed the implications of the genre of the novel, the social and gender issues, the symbolism, rhetorical program, and even considerable deal of philosophy! And the course structure facilitated a healthy, supportive, and enjoyable learning atmosphere."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I continued to learn about reading Greek, this time reading in large chunks of prose (chapters). I learned about “deep cuts” in the Greek world: the travel/romance novel is an under studied field in classics! I also learned about different approaches to scholarly writing in classics."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Weiberg is one of the most outstanding teachers I have ever had. She genuinely enjoys teaching and values the learning for the sake of learning. I can safely say and each and every one of her students has felt accommodated and welcomed. She has never hesitated to explain course material multiple times and assist me in ways that were beyond her responsibilities. 
The course had a structure that is very conducive to both learning and critical thinking. It had numerous components and helped us improve our Greek from different angles, as well as develop fresh and critical perspectives on the subject."

The class was also taught in a way that encouraged participation from everyone and invited all perspectives, which was helpful for me because I got to hear everyone's takes."

It lets you put time and effort into your work and demonstrate what you’ve learned without the pressure of getting a bad grade. It lets your performance reflect your effort.
