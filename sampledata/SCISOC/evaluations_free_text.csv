I learned to critically evaluate the use of racial categories in genomic studies and how they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes rather than address health disparities. The course also emphasized the importance of open communication and respectful discussion, allowing me to listen to and consider different perspectives with an open mind. Additionally, I gained insights into how race intersects with other identities, such as gender and socioeconomic status, to shape health outcomes, reinforcing the need for culturally competent care. These lessons have fostered a socially conscious and ethical approach to addressing systemic inequities in science and healthcare."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Learned how there are a multitude of stories behind language, terminology, and our understanding of the environment. 
2. The origin of colonialism and the anthropocene, and how this history shapes our modern outlooks on the environment and environmental justice. (Example - reviewing the influence of darwinism and what is ""natural"" and ""just"", etc.)
3. Narratives matter, and there are many of them. The differences between writers such as Locke, Darwin, Thoreau, Simmard, Kimmerer, Marsh, and more are astounding and reflect different understandings of the right of humans to take from this Earth and ultimately what the consequences of this become. These highlight how environmental issues cannot be divorced from questions of power, ethics, and equity. These different narratives allows us to evaluate historical paradigms (like commodification of nature) in context of the issues of today. These narratives show that environmental justice is not a single story and its ever-evolving to include and prioritize different ecological and social living systems. 
4. Environmental justice is not just about nature or wilderness. It's not just about economic opportunity. It's everything that surrounds us. It's about recognizing the right of everyone and everything, and the impact it leaves on everything else. It's about recognizing marginalized communities and preservation of spaces. It's about policymaking that reflects a commitment to the well-being of all things, as all things are interrelated. It shows the interconnected framework that integrates social equity, ecological health, and the well-being of all living systems. Environmental justice transcends any single issue. At its core, environmental justice is about reimagining the boundaries of ""us""/""them""/""we"" and instead honoring the reciprocity that must come with our globe through shared responsibility."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this course, I developed a more holistic understanding of medicine, moving beyond the rigid, science-focused perspective that dominates most of my other studies. I learned to view medicine through the lens of the humanities, realizing that understanding human experiences of illness, suffering, and healing requires more than just scientific knowledge. The course taught me that literature and the arts offer essential tools for developing empathy, which is critical in patient care. They not only foster compassion but also enhance our imagination and critical thinking, which are vital when dealing with complex or unconventional medical situations, such as in military settings. This expanded perspective has made me believe that the humanities are as crucial to medical practice as the hard sciences, helping us navigate the emotional and relational aspects of patient care that science alone cannot explain.
Additionally, the course sharpened my analytical skills and taught me the importance of engaging critically with materials. Instead of passively accepting the views presented in texts or media, I learned to question assumptions, contrast perspectives with my own medical experiences, and think critically about the information at hand. This skill has become especially valuable in a world where misinformation is rampant. Moreover, the course provided a unique collaborative learning environment, where I not only learned from the professor but also from my classmates, whose diverse backgrounds and experiences enriched my understanding of the material. Through this, I developed a deeper ability to listen carefully and empathetically, a skill that will be indispensable in my medical practice."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The overall learning environment of this class was shaped significantly by both the course structure and, more importantly, by Professor Apple’s teaching style. One component that stood out to me was the keyword readings, which were especially practical for understanding key concepts in medicine. Terms like “patient” were dissected in a way that revealed their complexity and depth, encouraging us to think critically about language and its implications in healthcare. These readings were invaluable in challenging our preconceived notions and reshaping the way we think about medical practice. The active class discussions that followed these readings further enriched my understanding. Engaging with peers in dialogue, guided by Professor Apple’s expertise, allowed us to explore various interpretations of the texts, connecting them to our own experiences in medicine. I think future iterations of the course could benefit from a balanced approach, perhaps a 50/50 split between didactic lectures and discussions. Having more time dedicated to exploring scholarly perspectives and Professor Apple’s own insights on the texts would be a great way to deepen our analysis and understanding.
However, the structure and components of the course were only part of what made it truly exceptional. Above all, it was Professor Apple’s character and teaching style that created a learning environment where I felt both intellectually challenged and personally inspired. Her positive attitude, enthusiasm, and the respect she showed for each student fostered a space of genuine curiosity and open dialogue. More than just teaching the course content, Professor Apple embodied the qualities of a compassionate, thoughtful, and ethical physician, and I learned just as much from her personal example as I did from the readings. A friend of mine from another university who sat in with me on one of her classes remarked that it was unlike any class he had ever experienced—highlighting the depth of the discussions and the dynamic group activities that Professor Apple facilitated. This feedback, along with my own experience, underscores her exceptional ability to teach and connect with students. Duke is fortunate to have such a dedicated and insightful instructor, and I believe future students will greatly benefit from the structure, content, and, most importantly, the teacher herself."

One of the most stimulating aspects was the class discussions themselves, where hearing from other students exposed me to perspectives I had not previously considered. These diverse viewpoints challenged my assumptions and expanded my thinking, emphasizing the value of deep listening in truly understanding complex issues. I came to realize that true comprehension does not always stem from agreeing with others, but rather from engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with their ideas. This ability to listen deeply and consider opposing perspectives is a crucial skill, both in medicine and in life.
Beyond the discussions, the readings chosen by Professor Apple were another key element of what made this class so intellectually enriching. The texts were not only thought-provoking but also incredibly relevant, as they delved into aspects of human behavior that are central to understanding the practice of medicine. These readings brought a practical dimension to our exploration, offering insights into how we can better understand and relate to patients, colleagues, and ourselves. They grounded theoretical ideas in real-world scenarios, making the intellectual experience both engaging and applicable. In this way, the course nicely combined rich intellectual content with practical applicability, creating a stimulating learning environment that was both deep and meaningful."

For pre-health students, the readings are particularly impactful, as they not only deepen your understanding of medical practice but also provide new perspectives on what it means to be a caring and empathetic doctor. The course challenges you to think beyond clinical skills, helping you reflect on the human side of medicine—how to truly listen to patients, understand their experiences, and approach care with both scientific knowledge and deep empathy. It’s a course that will not only shape you as a future healthcare provider but also as a more thoughtful, reflective individual."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Wow. Learned a lot. We started with a pretty fundamental overview of the history behind the philosophy of mind. We started with Descartes, the father of modern philosophy, and moved on from there. Our book, Minds and Computers, concluded with computational theory of mind, which argues that if humans are machines, the brain is basically the hardware and the mind is the software. However, Searle showed us that computationalism can't answer intentionality (formal programs can't constitute understanding), so we have tried to find other theories that may work to explain the mind. Between Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Brentano, Dennet, Hagel, we have come to realize the importance of subjective experience in the world. So far, I really like the embodied mind theory and its appeal to naturalism."

I would also continue with the hybrid lecture-work/presentation format. It allowed us to have different dynamics so that we weren't only sitting in a lecture for an 1hr 15 minutes.

The lecture slides are helpful to guide you, but Dr. Stewart's lectures themselves don't get very far through them. The quizzes are very writing intensive and make up almost your whole grade, and they will shock you at first with the content and quantity. I do think you get used to them over time and grades get better, but if you mess up badly on the first or second quiz, then the whole semester becomes really tough. Definitely a very intense course, so if that's something you want, go for it. You'll learn a lot about ethics, but you will be under pressure for sure."

I enjoyed the discussion posts as I think they help students learn, think, and assess their own opinions on topics. I think my favorite part of the class was the group presentations. All the groups picked very interesting healthcare issues and I enjoyed getting to learn about some of the specific topics in our healthcare system that were not covered in class. I also appreciate not having a final. Having tests would change the dynamic of the class. The current structure allows for students to debate about topics, and really think about the endless list of healthcare issues our system has. Having a final or other test would change the dynamic into something that people have to memorize the information instead of analyzing and reflecting upon the topics."

Sometimes, you might find yourself more curious about the global perspective (which I guess is Global Health), but those thoughts dissipate once you're drawn into the complexities of the U.S. health care system. It's a really fun and insightful class, but it can also be a bit draining too. It's sad to hear about policies actively working against providing universal health care access, and it's even worse to hear about specific issues we're too powerless to change. Regardless, this course was quite outstanding, both in its material and the professor, and I would certainly recommend it!"

It's a really fun and insightful class, but it can also be a bit draining too.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this course, I developed a more holistic understanding of medicine, moving beyond the rigid, science-focused perspective that dominates most of my other studies. I learned to view medicine through the lens of the humanities, realizing that understanding human experiences of illness, suffering, and healing requires more than just scientific knowledge. The course taught me that literature and the arts offer essential tools for developing empathy, which is critical in patient care. They not only foster compassion but also enhance our imagination and critical thinking, which are vital when dealing with complex or unconventional medical situations, such as in military settings. This expanded perspective has made me believe that the humanities are as crucial to medical practice as the hard sciences, helping us navigate the emotional and relational aspects of patient care that science alone cannot explain.
Additionally, the course sharpened my analytical skills and taught me the importance of engaging critically with materials. Instead of passively accepting the views presented in texts or media, I learned to question assumptions, contrast perspectives with my own medical experiences, and think critically about the information at hand. This skill has become especially valuable in a world where misinformation is rampant. Moreover, the course provided a unique collaborative learning environment, where I not only learned from the professor but also from my classmates, whose diverse backgrounds and experiences enriched my understanding of the material. Through this, I developed a deeper ability to listen carefully and empathetically, a skill that will be indispensable in my medical practice."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The overall learning environment of this class was shaped significantly by both the course structure and, more importantly, by Professor Apple’s teaching style. One component that stood out to me was the keyword readings, which were especially practical for understanding key concepts in medicine. Terms like “patient” were dissected in a way that revealed their complexity and depth, encouraging us to think critically about language and its implications in healthcare. These readings were invaluable in challenging our preconceived notions and reshaping the way we think about medical practice. The active class discussions that followed these readings further enriched my understanding. Engaging with peers in dialogue, guided by Professor Apple’s expertise, allowed us to explore various interpretations of the texts, connecting them to our own experiences in medicine. I think future iterations of the course could benefit from a balanced approach, perhaps a 50/50 split between didactic lectures and discussions. Having more time dedicated to exploring scholarly perspectives and Professor Apple’s own insights on the texts would be a great way to deepen our analysis and understanding.
However, the structure and components of the course were only part of what made it truly exceptional. Above all, it was Professor Apple’s character and teaching style that created a learning environment where I felt both intellectually challenged and personally inspired. Her positive attitude, enthusiasm, and the respect she showed for each student fostered a space of genuine curiosity and open dialogue. More than just teaching the course content, Professor Apple embodied the qualities of a compassionate, thoughtful, and ethical physician, and I learned just as much from her personal example as I did from the readings. A friend of mine from another university who sat in with me on one of her classes remarked that it was unlike any class he had ever experienced—highlighting the depth of the discussions and the dynamic group activities that Professor Apple facilitated. This feedback, along with my own experience, underscores her exceptional ability to teach and connect with students. Duke is fortunate to have such a dedicated and insightful instructor, and I believe future students will greatly benefit from the structure, content, and, most importantly, the teacher herself."

One of the most stimulating aspects was the class discussions themselves, where hearing from other students exposed me to perspectives I had not previously considered. These diverse viewpoints challenged my assumptions and expanded my thinking, emphasizing the value of deep listening in truly understanding complex issues. I came to realize that true comprehension does not always stem from agreeing with others, but rather from engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with their ideas. This ability to listen deeply and consider opposing perspectives is a crucial skill, both in medicine and in life.
Beyond the discussions, the readings chosen by Professor Apple were another key element of what made this class so intellectually enriching. The texts were not only thought-provoking but also incredibly relevant, as they delved into aspects of human behavior that are central to understanding the practice of medicine. These readings brought a practical dimension to our exploration, offering insights into how we can better understand and relate to patients, colleagues, and ourselves. They grounded theoretical ideas in real-world scenarios, making the intellectual experience both engaging and applicable. In this way, the course nicely combined rich intellectual content with practical applicability, creating a stimulating learning environment that was both deep and meaningful."

The exploration of literature and medicine offers profound insights into what it truly means to be a compassionate and ethical human being, which is valuable in any field. For pre-health students, the readings are particularly impactful, as they not only deepen your understanding of medical practice but also provide new perspectives on what it means to be a caring and empathetic doctor. The course challenges you to think beyond clinical skills, helping you reflect on the human side of medicine—how to truly listen to patients, understand their experiences, and approach care with both scientific knowledge and deep empathy. It’s a course that will not only shape you as a future healthcare provider but also as a more thoughtful, reflective individual."

I do think you get used to them over time and grades get better, but if you mess up badly on the first or second quiz, then the whole semester becomes really tough. Definitely a very intense course, so if that's something you want, go for it. You'll learn a lot about ethics, but you will be under pressure for sure."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Learned how there are a multitude of stories behind language, terminology, and our understanding of the environment. 
2. The origin of colonialism and the anthropocene, and how this history shapes our modern outlooks on the environment and environmental justice. (Example - reviewing the influence of darwinism and what is ""natural"" and ""just"", etc.)
3. Narratives matter, and there are many of them. The differences between writers such as Locke, Darwin, Thoreau, Simmard, Kimmerer, Marsh, and more are astounding and reflect different understandings of the right of humans to take from this Earth and ultimately what the consequences of this become. These highlight how environmental issues cannot be divorced from questions of power, ethics, and equity. These different narratives allows us to evaluate historical paradigms (like commodification of nature) in context of the issues of today. These narratives show that environmental justice is not a single story and its ever-evolving to include and prioritize different ecological and social living systems. 
4. Environmental justice is not just about nature or wilderness. It's not just about economic opportunity. It's everything that surrounds us. It's about recognizing the right of everyone and everything, and the impact it leaves on everything else. It's about recognizing marginalized communities and preservation of spaces. It's about policymaking that reflects a commitment to the well-being of all things, as all things are interrelated. It shows the interconnected framework that integrates social equity, ecological health, and the well-being of all living systems. Environmental justice transcends any single issue. At its core, environmental justice is about reimagining the boundaries of ""us""/""them""/""we"" and instead honoring the reciprocity that must come with our globe through shared responsibility."

I have a tendency to react to the substance of what is being said and not really observe the unspoken things happening and this class really focused on making sure we were paying attention to that in ways that are very useful. The idea of taking the point of discussion as a MacGuffin has been really helpful. Seeing some political actions more as theatre than as about the actual issues was also really helpful and has made it a lot easier for me to parse what is happening politically. Finally, I really appreciated how much focus was placed on identifying ideologies, especially the California ideology.

This framework allowed us to stay focus on the class topic without straying too far into political opinions. I thought that Casey offered enough time for us to just talk and develop our own thoughts with a good balance of substantive lectures to guide us.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Wow. Learned a lot. We started with a pretty fundamental overview of the history behind the philosophy of mind. We started with Descartes, the father of modern philosophy, and moved on from there. Our book, Minds and Computers, concluded with computational theory of mind, which argues that if humans are machines, the brain is basically the hardware and the mind is the software. However, Searle showed us that computationalism can't answer intentionality (formal programs can't constitute understanding), so we have tried to find other theories that may work to explain the mind. Between Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Brentano, Dennet, Hagel, we have come to realize the importance of subjective experience in the world. So far, I really like the embodied mind theory and its appeal to naturalism."
