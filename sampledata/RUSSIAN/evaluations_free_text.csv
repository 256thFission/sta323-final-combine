I think the final project is a little restrictive because you need to have access to a native speaker so we can't really research languages that are more obscure. I think native speaker conversations are important, so maybe could introduce a midterm project where students research a more obscure/endangered/less commonly studied language to research."

Our class discussions were focused in small groups, so everyone had a chance to talk if they wanted to. The focus was getting us to love the worlds we were interacting with, and that was definitely achieved. We also wrote journal entries with every assignment, which personally really helped me to break down my thoughts about what I'd read and just gave me a space to analyze/work things out."
