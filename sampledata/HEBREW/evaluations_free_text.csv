One of the other major components of the course was the portfolio, which was helpful but also a bit ambiguous in its purpose. As a place to summarize out-of-class Hebrew experiences (this was my interpretation), I found this helpful, but then I don't understand the point of spending valuable time on formatting rather than the content. I was also seeing different interpretations throughout the class. If this is truly meant to be a ""choose your own adventure"" style of project, I would recommend grading it as such—if people don't think formatting is going to be intellectually stimulating, look to the components they list. If there was a more material realization to the project, I would recommend providing some examples so people can focus their effort on the intellectually-stimulating task at hand."

However, given the nature of the course, people start in various different places.

She was willing to accommodate students' needs and tailor the experience to different students. I enjoyed the presentations and the guest speaker, as they allowed me to practice my Hebrew through interesting topics. I also think that the portfolio was a good way to stay on top of the material."

She was very accommodating and understanding of personal student situition. She always made sure she did her part in student success by being so supportive with the quizzes, homework, extra help, and validity. One course component I would keep is the Hebrew workbook which I learned a lot from. A second course component I would keep is the Hebrew conversation hours that truly allowed me to improve my talking skills and learn more. A third course component I would keep is the creative freedom of the project and the Hebrew portfolios which I enjoyed a lot."

However, Professor Baker was so accommodating and led the class in a way that could help enrich everyone. Everyone had to do the same basic assignments, but for people who wanted more of a challenge, Professor Baker always offered additional resources and encouraged students to challenge themselves outside the course. I think that was a great way to make sure everyone was getting something out of the course, no matter how much they came in knowing."

Also, the class could have easily been split into two general levels, which probably would have been best for everyone. The content was also literally for israeli fourth graders. I feel like we could have had college level content with intermediate/ newly advanced hebrew"

I know that grammar is obviously an important part of the language, but I think it is also important to learn about things beyond the rules. For example, it would have been cool to have a class on Israeli slang, and see what words and phrases are actually very common in Israel. I also wish we had done a bit more with pop culture. We had a poet come in to speak to us and we read his work, and I really enjoyed that, so I think doing more of that or watching an episode of an Israeli TV show or listening to Israeli songs and talking about them could be very beneficial. Basically, I just think we should have done more that exposed us to real Israeli culture (that would also help with our understanding of the language) than we did."

Whatever I was expecting, though, was not what I was met with. Prof. Baker is very kind, enthusiastic, and fair in her assignments and her grading; that said, we spent the entire semester reviewing grammar forms that I learned in middle school and early high school.While this was a nice review, I can confidently say that I did not learn speak and write any more fluently, did not pick up any slang or the ability to watch fast-paced Hebrew movies, and did not read real Hebrew literature. We worked out of a workbook the entire semester, only read news articles on a platform with small articles meant for Hebrew beginners, and even when we expressed the desire to learn from more applicable sources were not met with engaging, challenging material. Classes were essentially a lecture, with hardly any Hebrew spoken by us. This would have been a good intermediate class, but was definitely not meant to be a 300-level language course."
