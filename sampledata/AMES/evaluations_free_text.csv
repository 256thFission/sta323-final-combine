I felt like the course provided many opportunities to develop both creative and critical projects that I felt proud of. Many of the texts/films/media that we read throughout the class were familiar to me, but others were not. Regardless, the material covered in class helped me recontextualize those familiar works, and the unfamiliar ones added a new layer to my understanding of East Asian culture. The class also offers many opportunities to work with other students (casually, and more in-depth), and it was amazing to see what other students could contribute or what their interests were. This was a class where I learned from students as much as I did from Dr. Chow, Mingkang, and the readings."

This made it so I always had lots of questions about the material, which I always came in to class prepared with, in addition to questions posed by the in-class lectures. I also liked that we went in chronological order considering the things we were learning about present-day Iran made sense considering what we had learned about Persian history/culture from the very beginning. I wish that we had a little more organized lecture/Powerpoint introduction to the topics we focused on earlier in the class; I found it really helpful later on when we started talking about the Shah/revolution, and think it could have been effective in portraying earlier themes."

The annotated filmography was especially useful—it pushed me to analyze films independently while still connecting them to broader class themes. I’d definitely keep that assignment for future years.

She was an incredibly approachable, flexible, and caring professor and created an environment where it felt like we were really able to think critically while also having fun in a low-stakes environment. The course's selected topics and the sequence in which these topics were presented were logical and coherent. I appreciated that Emily took the time to contextualize each new topic we discussed within the scope of what we had learned thus far. Topics were well-connected and referenced each other, which gave me a deeper appreciation for the course's ethnomusicological lens and each of the individual musics. Emily did a fantastic job of fostering a friendly and supportive class environment. Despite the larger class size, it felt like we were able to have discussions, share ideas, and get to know each other's ways of thinking. Emily also seemed genuinely interested in learning from us, fostering a non-hierarchical classroom environment (versus one where the professor clearly presents as the all-knowing expert uninterested in students' insights) that I think greatly encouraged students' independent thinking. Karaoke was a lot of fun and also helped build camaraderie among the class. I think all of the assignments were meaningful and useful while also leaving plenty of room for our own thinking and creativity (e.g. 3 you pick listening journals and a very open-ended final project). Course assignments were structured in a way that leaves options and appeals to a diversity of strengths and weaknesses (e.g. appealing to those who prefer test-taking vs. essay-writing and to those who prefer independent vs group work). Most of all, this class was fun! It's such a relief to have a class that is genuinely fun, where the professor is also excited to just have fun while still learning a lot."

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

Additional to the structure I enjoyed that there were only two major assignments to do throughout the whole semester.

It's definitely the right idea, but sometimes the instructions were vague and the links were hard to find. I would certainly keep these graded readings, and expand on the feedback. The lectures were always excellent and the professors always came OVERLY prepared. It was impressive and refreshing to be taught by professors who had too many slides and could talk for hours on their subject. Don't change a thing about the lectures."

I think that in other classes it's more geared toward understanding an essence, and while it still holds for historical documents, you also need to immerse yourself in the time the event occurred to truly understand it.

The Masnavi contains a reference in the back that is especially important to look up, since Rumi makes many metaphors and references that those not familiar with aspects of the Islamic faith are likely to miss. Attar is more comprehensible but he is by nature a poet, and so should also be read in this way.Read the texts very carefully."

One of the biggest lessons I took away is that not every question has a clear answer but the process of thinking through them is what leads to true understanding.

I really appreciated how he goes out of his way to facilitate meaningful discussion inside (and outside of class). Instead of just asking discussion questions in class he encourages us to dig deeper by challenging the points we make. For our midterm assignments we are provided with copious amounts of helpful feedback that we and then encouraged to use when revising out essays. This process has made me a better writer and challenged me to put more thought and care into my written assignments. Above all things academic I truly believe that Professor Schanzer cares deeply about his students success and well being. He is always willing to meet outside of class and take great care to get to know his students. Overall Professor Schanzer is a great teacher and he teaches a great course!"

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The purely discussion based nature of this class based on readings that we did outside of class made it so my learning was compounded. Professor Schanzer would start each class with a question that would lead to the remaining time being spent in discussion with students building off of each others' ideas or disagreeing with points made. The way that everyone was encouraged to share their reactions/ideas based on the readings made it so I would come in to class thinking one way, and always leave class with new ideas about different policies, military actions, presidential decisions, etc.. I would definitely keep the discussion sections in following years, and maybe even reverting back to a smaller class size to encourage participation. Having Ken was super helpful too in having someone present that was actually in Afghanistan/Iraq and could speak on the military aspects of the conflicts before and after 9/11. Having a CTTP fellow next year with a similar background would be great. Also I really liked how we went in chronological order all the way back thousands of years, at first I was confused what Sayyid Qutb would have to do with 9/11 all the way back in the 1930s, but then it all made sense."

He made it clear that he held us to high standards in our writing and classroom discussions, so we felt pushed to put in our best work. Therefore, my engagement in this class was higher than usual, as I knew I would be challenged and wanted to succeed/meet Schanzer's approval. Schanzer is also very skilled at facilitating discussions, prompting and challenging our opinions and forcing us to think more deeply about complicated issues.I also really liked the structure and flow of the course and how we zoomed in on different topics--contemporary or historical--while also maintaining a broad understanding of the necessary background info, i.e., the history of Muslim civilization. My favorite topic we zoomed in on was probably the Israel Palestine discussion. I did not have much to add personally that day since I did not have much background info, but I really benefitted from hearing what my classmates with differing opinions had to say, as well as Schanzer's insight. I also liked the homegrown terrorism and TSA/airport discussions a lot, as my classmates and I had a lot of differing views and personal experiences with these topics."

He routinely picks to respond to what was a minor point of what you were saying and launch into a rant about something and often lose the audience.

Especially because policy is inherently political; therefore, we usually were dealing with topics that had at least two sides. Professor Schanzer pushed back on everyone, no matter what side they were taking, encouraging to consider things from another perspective. He would always respond to our points with ""what about when this happened..."" or ""so you're saying..."" and it always made us think more about what we said in the context of things we might not have considered in our conclusions. I think the discussion sections were especially good for this because I got to hear more people speak in a more intimate environment, which always helped challenge my thoughts even when it wasn't Prof Schanzer/Ken directly asking me follow up questions. 
Also rewrites are an awesome opportunity to get critical feedback and rework some of our ideas."

I liked the readings as well, especially when we were assigned videos/documentary-like explanations of topics as I am a visual learner. It was very cool when we were given specific, more personal anecdotes to read/watch as those are extra engaging, i.e., the video on terrorist recruitment. Whenever Ken shared his personal experiences with class topics was also fascinating. I already mentioned really liking the flow of the course topics, but Schanzer was really good at laying everything out for us in a very structured way that was helpful for me to visualize."

If you're interested in national security and American foreign policy, I highly recommend this course. If you would like to analyze America's response to 9/11 through a more progressive, human rights centric lens, this course does not delve deep into that topic."

I came in with no knowledge about the history of the middle east, and Professor Goknar wastes no time diving into the deep end of the content. However, this turned out to be extremely rewarding, and I think that taking challenging courses is the entire point of college.

Although the content is sometimes challenging, it is incredibly stimulating, and Professor Goknar is kind in his grading so that I was never worried about failing this course, only working harder."

We learned about how natural resource management requires inter-state collaboration that can be challenging in conflict-prone areas, and how such collaboration can be leveraged to further political gain.  We learned about how to use first-hand and narrative sources to trace the development of political ideologies and movements, and how to consider the experiences of individuals in conflict.  We learned, most of all, that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is a deeply complicated one with extensive historical background underlying the actions and motivations of both sides."

Prof. Wong jumps straight into the materially and discusses it with you on an even playing field, encourages you to familiarize yourself quickly so you can engage with the discussion.

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class. Take this course esepcially if you want to read more and read these types of texts and engage with them in a relaxed and growth-centered manner but dont have the time in your personal life or other classes to do so.

You don't need any prior knowledge of the topic to take the course. The professor is really nice and class is generally pretty engaging. The class is quite a lot of work, and it certainly isn't easy. You need to do a lot of reading and write a weekly discussion post on the reading, and you have a couple big papers which are tough.

While visiting the pyramids was a highlight, the overall experience was stressful and lacked the immersive, enriching quality one would hope for in a study abroad program. The professor was not understanding of students’ well-being, often disregarding exhaustion, illness, or logistical delays, and dismissing concerns with comments like 'you're a Duke student.' His teaching style included frequent irrelevant rants and unsolicited political commentary, which made many students uncomfortable. Additionally, much of the course content felt repetitive and unimpactful — visiting similar sites repeatedly without meaningful academic engagement. Weekend trips were exhausting and rushed, leaving little time to actually take in the experiences. The professor was largely absent outside of class and trips, and offered little personal engagement with students.On top of this, there were unexpected out-of-pocket costs that added up quickly, even for group meals that were supposed to be included. Given the high program cost, this was frustrating. Assignment deadlines were rigid, regardless of student health or circumstances, and there was a clear lack of empathy when students were sick or overwhelmed.Honestly, there’s so much about this program that could be talked about for hours — from the disorganization to the exhausting schedule, to the uncomfortable moments with the professor. If I could do it over, I would choose a different study abroad program that better balances academic rigor with cultural immersion and student well-being. The photos might look nice, but they don’t reflect the reality of the experience."

I also absolutely loved all the projects in this class (mapping a Chinatown and food ethnography). And of course, the TCG was not only super fun, it challenged me to apply what I learned in class into developing my character lore, creating feasible proposals, and engaging with other characters of LA Chinatown."

I didn't realize the professor didn't until it was too late.  There were only general topics but I had no idea about how much reading was expected of us (more than 100 pages of academic journals per week). The same goes for the collaborative mini projects, which had no due dates, which made it difficult to plan ahead. I did not like how one was due shortly after spring break. Overall, I did not like how the syllabus was not clear. In all my other readings-heavy classes, weekly readings expectations are clearly listed in the syllabus and posted in Sakai beforehand so we have a taste of what we have to read. The professor posted each batch of readings a few weeks before and I had no idea what or how much was expected.

You don't necessarily need a background in any of them to succeed, because Liu laoshi is willing to help you through it, but I think it helps in being able to understand the concepts faster. I only knew a little Chinese, and I had taken a linguistics course the semester before taking this class, and I think my linguistics knowledge made up for my Chinese knowledge. I think most other people in the class had a bit more background in Chinese but not as much in linguistics, so it depends. However, everyone was able to produce pretty successful research projects by the end of the semester, and there's a place for everyone's interests in the research project! I will say, the course can be a lot of reading at times, and the research project can be time-consuming depending on how you're collecting your data, so I would keep that in mind as you're balancing courses. My biggest takeaway from the course, though, is probably getting to learn more about my friends and their cultural experiences, so I would say that was worth it."

He reviews an array of analytical approaches in a simplified and accessible manner for undergraduate students while allowing the flexibility for students to maintain their own interpretations, provided they can defend their claims.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","A course that encompasses a breadth of material to critically interrogate what constitutes ""story"" and to whom. I learned about Eastern vs. Western storytelling modalities and the role of Orientalism in framing narratives in faraway lands through our unit on A Thousand and One Nights, as well as questioning if it is possible, in the guise of the modern novel with its emphasis on human consumption and emotion, to tell a story with a non-human subject by exploring the place of Sun Wu Kong in the Chinese literary canon. Turning our attention to familiar European storytelling traditions, we also studied the morphology of fairytales, as explicated by Vladimir Propp, and the socio-psychological imperatives baked into the archetypes of ""fairy stories,"" as posited by Tolkien. We likewise explored the ways the framework of game changes narratives structures by imposing ludology, rather than temporality, to guide stories."

These encouraged us to debate the elements of story and form our own opinions on how we form and digest narratives.

One specific thing I’ve learned is how to think critically in ways I hadn’t before. Now, when I read a book or watch a movie, I find myself looking for deeper connections. Discussing these ideas in class with my peers has also opened me up to new perspectives, helping me understand the text or media in ways I wouldn’t have on my own.

We learned about how to use first-hand and narrative sources to trace the development of political ideologies and movements, and how to consider the experiences of individuals in conflict.  We learned, most of all, that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is a deeply complicated one with extensive historical background underlying the actions and motivations of both sides."

-I strengthened my ability to closely read and interpret film and literature through weekly paragraph reflections and analytical essays. This course helped me shift from surface-level observation to deep cultural critique.
-I learned to conduct archival and secondary research for literary analysis, particularly through our Rubenstein Library visit and the library session on sourcing academic criticism for our final paper."

It taught me how to draw meaningful connections across various forms of media, from movies and books to short stories and anime. One specific thing I’ve learned is how to think critically in ways I hadn’t before. Now, when I read a book or watch a movie, I find myself looking for deeper connections. Discussing these ideas in class with my peers has also opened me up to new perspectives, helping me understand the text or media in ways I wouldn’t have on my own. I also became a better writer, being able to incorporate multiple resources, and flesh out strong arguments that I can write a paper about. And I now have a very strong understanding of the meaning of ""the post apocalypse""."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","It was interesting learning about the history of Japan. I think the biggest skill I took away from this experience was critical thinking, as in understanding the complexities of historical documentation. I also learned how to pick apart a text from a historical narrative. I think that in other classes it's more geared toward understanding an essence, and while it still holds for historical documents, you also need to immerse yourself in the time the event occurred to truly understand it. I also broaden my way of thinking, which I think has become more fluid and less rigid because of the course."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The way of thinking I developed during this course was unique to other classes. I learned that to understand history you have to understand there are different perspectives and that not everything is black and white. As an example, although women faced massive amounts of discrimination throughout ancient Japanese history there are extraordinary examples of women being leaders, writers, and equals in society. Three specific things I learned was different art forms (Nō, Kabuki, etc), societal systems, and the relationships Japan had with outside states (Korea, China, Netherlands etc)"

He reviews an array of analytical approaches in a simplified and accessible manner for undergraduate students while allowing the flexibility for students to maintain their own interpretations, provided they can defend their claims. The depth and complexity of assigned reading material could be relevant at a graduate, not just undergraduate, level.

But I feel I learned a lot from suffering in these classes.HOWEVER, the suffering she makes you feel is meaningless. Completely meaningless. Throughout the semester, she will find you a lot of troubles and she is zero-tolerant to any mistakes you made. She never attempts to empathize with your life and what you experience. She is only a MACHINE, a cold machine, to enforce rules.Ok, you might not be a picky person about who teach the class. But in her class, you will not succeed by grinding before exams. The exams only contribute a small percent to your grade. Basically, this class will DOMINATE your life. You have to be constantly hardworking to succeed. Imagine, college can be stressful, well, most of the time. You don’t want to add another layer of misery to your life, trust me."

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class. Take this course esepcially if you want to read more and read these types of texts and engage with them in a relaxed and growth-centered manner but dont have the time in your personal life or other classes to do so.

She was an incredibly approachable, flexible, and caring professor and created an environment where it felt like we were really able to think critically while also having fun in a low-stakes environment. The course's selected topics and the sequence in which these topics were presented were logical and coherent. I appreciated that Emily took the time to contextualize each new topic we discussed within the scope of what we had learned thus far. Topics were well-connected and referenced each other, which gave me a deeper appreciation for the course's ethnomusicological lens and each of the individual musics. Emily did a fantastic job of fostering a friendly and supportive class environment. Despite the larger class size, it felt like we were able to have discussions, share ideas, and get to know each other's ways of thinking. Emily also seemed genuinely interested in learning from us, fostering a non-hierarchical classroom environment (versus one where the professor clearly presents as the all-knowing expert uninterested in students' insights) that I think greatly encouraged students' independent thinking. Karaoke was a lot of fun and also helped build camaraderie among the class. I think all of the assignments were meaningful and useful while also leaving plenty of room for our own thinking and creativity (e.g. 3 you pick listening journals and a very open-ended final project). Course assignments were structured in a way that leaves options and appeals to a diversity of strengths and weaknesses (e.g. appealing to those who prefer test-taking vs. essay-writing and to those who prefer independent vs group work). Most of all, this class was fun! It's such a relief to have a class that is genuinely fun, where the professor is also excited to just have fun while still learning a lot."

From the modern pop music in Asia (well, East Asia to be more exact) and Asian America, you actually learn tremendously about the historical reason behind why certain music sounds like a certain way coming from these countries and cultures, and it's a methodology extremely applicable to analyzing the music of other geographies -- we do a lot of cross cultural analysis in music beyond just Asian music as well."

I really appreciated how he goes out of his way to facilitate meaningful discussion inside (and outside of class). Instead of just asking discussion questions in class he encourages us to dig deeper by challenging the points we make. For our midterm assignments we are provided with copious amounts of helpful feedback that we and then encouraged to use when revising out essays. This process has made me a better writer and challenged me to put more thought and care into my written assignments. Above all things academic I truly believe that Professor Schanzer cares deeply about his students success and well being. He is always willing to meet outside of class and take great care to get to know his students. Overall Professor Schanzer is a great teacher and he teaches a great course!"

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The purely discussion based nature of this class based on readings that we did outside of class made it so my learning was compounded. Professor Schanzer would start each class with a question that would lead to the remaining time being spent in discussion with students building off of each others' ideas or disagreeing with points made. The way that everyone was encouraged to share their reactions/ideas based on the readings made it so I would come in to class thinking one way, and always leave class with new ideas about different policies, military actions, presidential decisions, etc.. I would definitely keep the discussion sections in following years, and maybe even reverting back to a smaller class size to encourage participation. Having Ken was super helpful too in having someone present that was actually in Afghanistan/Iraq and could speak on the military aspects of the conflicts before and after 9/11. Having a CTTP fellow next year with a similar background would be great. Also I really liked how we went in chronological order all the way back thousands of years, at first I was confused what Sayyid Qutb would have to do with 9/11 all the way back in the 1930s, but then it all made sense."

He made it clear that he held us to high standards in our writing and classroom discussions, so we felt pushed to put in our best work. Therefore, my engagement in this class was higher than usual, as I knew I would be challenged and wanted to succeed/meet Schanzer's approval. Schanzer is also very skilled at facilitating discussions, prompting and challenging our opinions and forcing us to think more deeply about complicated issues.I also really liked the structure and flow of the course and how we zoomed in on different topics--contemporary or historical--while also maintaining a broad understanding of the necessary background info, i.e., the history of Muslim civilization. My favorite topic we zoomed in on was probably the Israel Palestine discussion. I did not have much to add personally that day since I did not have much background info, but I really benefitted from hearing what my classmates with differing opinions had to say, as well as Schanzer's insight. I also liked the homegrown terrorism and TSA/airport discussions a lot, as my classmates and I had a lot of differing views and personal experiences with these topics."

However, I felt class discussions were sometimes boring. Sometimes the professor would pick what I thought to be dull areas to probe (I.e. the legality of something as opposed to whether it was right strategically or ethically). My primary qualm, however, is how he responds to points you make in class. He routinely picks to respond to what was a minor point of what you were saying and launch into a rant about something and often lose the audience. I like how he pushes people on their responses, but I wish he wouldn't respond with long rants"

Especially because policy is inherently political; therefore, we usually were dealing with topics that had at least two sides. Professor Schanzer pushed back on everyone, no matter what side they were taking, encouraging to consider things from another perspective. He would always respond to our points with ""what about when this happened..."" or ""so you're saying..."" and it always made us think more about what we said in the context of things we might not have considered in our conclusions. I think the discussion sections were especially good for this because I got to hear more people speak in a more intimate environment, which always helped challenge my thoughts even when it wasn't Prof Schanzer/Ken directly asking me follow up questions. 
Also rewrites are an awesome opportunity to get critical feedback and rework some of our ideas."

I liked the readings as well, especially when we were assigned videos/documentary-like explanations of topics as I am a visual learner. It was very cool when we were given specific, more personal anecdotes to read/watch as those are extra engaging, i.e., the video on terrorist recruitment. Whenever Ken shared his personal experiences with class topics was also fascinating. I already mentioned really liking the flow of the course topics, but Schanzer was really good at laying everything out for us in a very structured way that was helpful for me to visualize."

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.
