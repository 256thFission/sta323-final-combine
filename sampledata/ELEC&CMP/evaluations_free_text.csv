Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",Provided lecture notes helped when I missed something during lecture so I could quickly reference it and keep up with what was being discussed. The 4 labs should be kept as they are. It reduces stress to have 4 labs that do not have out-of-class reports and each lab was also structured highly focused on a particular topic discussed in class.

All we did was derivations for the same thing three different times (transmission lines, electromagnetic waves, acoustics). The lectures just had a bunch of algebra and didn't build any physical intuition as to what we were learning and how to apply it. I felt like we didn't learn enough applications or do enough examples in lecture to be able to do some of the homework problems. I would definitely incorporate more examples into lecture instead of having so many derivations for random things. We're given a bunch of equations and the homeworks and exams are just searching for the correct equations to plug the numbers into. I would enjoy the class more if the course built more on our physical intuition of what all these equations actually meant or showed, rather than plugging into equations."

The course is trying to take a bunch of domain-specific rules and relate them all to each other (and it does a very good job of this), but that doesn't remove the fact that most of what's covered is presented specific to each domain so that even when we acknowledge the fact that content from, say, transmission lines, is relevant to what we learn about quantum, the concepts aren't as transferrable."

If lecture time is going to be used going through formula derivations, at least try to scatter some intuition and motivation within all of the mathematics. If one is just expected to know and apply the formulas, use lectures to go through problem-solving examples and give motivation. Students will match the energy of the professor and TAs.

Do your best to take good notes and study slides or resources later. If you like physics this class is likely very easy and similar to most physics courses though for me who has limited physics knowledge it certainly feels similar to physics but with some other components.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The disorganization on this course was beyond levels I have ever experienced in my entire academic career, and teetered on the border of not respecting student's time.
To begin, there is no syllabus, leaving students to guess policies in the class, and allowed prof smith to change policies on the whim. First of all, he had said that there would be three midterms, of which a student could drop the lowest score. Then due to the mean score being a 37/80 and median score being a 35/80 on the first exam (open note), he revoked this policy. Then he said the fact that the first exam was open note made the scores lower, because we had ""too much information"" to sift through, and ""got confused"" as if the concepts were ever clear in the class anyways. It's possible that the scores were so low due to incorrect equations being on the powerpoint, as a couple of students have caught flagrant typos among his copies of notes, and it is very difficult to check all the equations he provides since we don't have a textbook. Further, there was a question on the first exam that was not solvable, which he didn't know abt sicne he doesn't make answer keys before the exams. 
For the second exam, we had 1 homework assignment, assigned the monday before the friday of the exam. Due to student concerns over this very short amount of time, prof smith held extra hours at 7pm the day before the exam, of which he was 20 minutes late to and when arrived, was not able to solve/explain some of the problems on the practice exam / review powerpoint. He then revealed that the questions from the powerpoint he had found online, and were not actually super relevant to the exam we would be taking the next day. The second exam, which he promised would be easier than the first, was so long that not a single student finished more than 70% of the exam. In making the key, prof smith himself admitted that the exam was too difficult. Writing this today as of 4/25 we still have not received our scores for the second exam (taken on 3/29).
These are just some symptoms of prof smith's inability to run a class. Beyond this lack of organization skills or respect for student's effort and time, he is one of those professors who will copy notes directly from his powerpoint, and has very fuzzy explanations when student's ask questions. In fact, sometimes he will be halfway through a derivation and suddenly say oh something is wrong and then sends a 3 paragraph email later about what was wrong. many times he shows up to lecture, it feels as though he has not prepared at all. He does not provide enough explanation at all as to where certain equations come from, as well as the logic and ways to think about a problem. Class is just him deriving equations and no one has any idea where they came from, or which equations are just intermediate steps and which are actually important, and how these equations would apply to real applications. 
Due to prof smith's disorganized teaching methods and poor lecturing skills, he has had to spend a lot of time re teaching subjects (to no avail since he doesn't explain anything) and we were so behind that for three weeks, we could't take the weekly content quiz during our discussion because we had not learned anything new, so every monday all students would trek to teer to have some TA say ""no quiz"" and then we all leave immediately (great use of time thanks!). We are so behind the other class, and regular schedule of 270, and still learned nothing. 
No one has any idea where their grade sits right now
It's kind of an open secret among ECE students that prof smith usually runs a disorganized class, with average scores being low and everyone being curved up to an A, but for a core ECE class like 270, we all wish we could have learned something valuable."

I often found myself staring at pages of equations without really knowing what many of the symbols meant. They had names, but I couldn't really place what they meant physically or what tangible intuition governed their existence. I think if there were more chances to talk through specific problems in class in order to give students better intuition about the rules of this field (pun intended), it would be easier to internalize the conceptually difficult parts of the curriculum. This would make the class easier to follow, and when sitting down to do homework assignments, there would be some examples to work off of to help along the way."

However, a lot of the topics and equations took a long time to sink in, if they ever did. I never fully understood a lot of the derivations for the equations we used, but those derivations were (mainly) the only way we were provided for understanding why those equations are what they are.
