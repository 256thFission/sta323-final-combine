If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

The days we were split into smaller groups within our discussion groups was when I  would actually meet and talk with people."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class.

I also developed a greater understanding of Jewish-German history and culture in the Modernist time period. I had already consumed some of the media (film and literature mainly) that we discussed in this course, but through our in-depth class discussions, I learned to see these and many new materials through alternative perspectives. It was particularly exciting to discuss the context of different works and ponder the potential implications these contexts could have on the overall meaning of literature, film, and art. Finally, this course helped me develop an understanding of and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of people and ideas. Throughout the course, we saw the connections and overlap between the authors, artists, filmmakers, and philosophers located in Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. It truly made me appreciate and ponder the ways in which information is spread. And, how inspiration is spread as well."

It also helped that Dr. Gellen is clearly very passionate about the subject which made me excited to learn more and ask questions in class. I thought there was a good balance between papers and presentations. Grading was fair. I also really liked how often we finished the entire assigned reading (either because Dr. Gellen chose shorter works or they were spread out over several class periods). I  think I got more out of the short stories/novellas in particular by reading the entire thing rather than just an excerpt from the story.

I particularly enjoyed the days structured with multiple types of learning activities. For example: individual presentations, a small group exercise, lecture, and larger class discussion. I found the variety of modes of instruction kept each class session exciting and also allowed for students of all learning styles to engage with the materials in different ways. The class itself was also a positive space to participate in, as I found that a strong sense of community was fostered early in the semester through small group activities and lunch during class."

I thought the reading assignments seemed carefully chosen to build on our understanding of German-Jewish culture and our abilities to understand more complicated texts as the course progressed. I loved how we also looked at poetry and film and the days where we looked at the early editions of the books at Rubenstein were so cool and fun! I knew almost nothing about this topic before taking this class and I am so glad that I took this class. I learned so much and genuinely enjoyed coming to class every day. I wouldn't have been able to appreciate a lot of the material without the support/guidance of this class.

I came into this course with very minimal knowledge about Modern German-Jewish history, literature, and culture. This course immersed me completely in the thoughts and ideas of a time period that I had never studied before and taught me to look at works of art and literature through a different lens. Authors and historical figures I was already familiar with, such as Kafka and Freud, took on new significance following our course discussions, and that in itself was incredibly stimulating. I loved being able to learn more about these figures and their work, as well as hear the thoughts of Professor Gellen and my classmates."

Don't be afraid if you are not Jewish, have no history/literature background, etc. because neither did I, and it meant that I was even more impressed with how much I had learned! I think that it is not an easy course and definitely challenges your German, but by the end of the semester you will be shocked by how much you've improved, and how the class actually feels less difficult by the end.

This course is excellently structured so that a student grows to understand the developments of German-Jewish culture in three cities: Vienna, Prague, and Berlin. Through a journey of popular and more obscure works of art, literature, and cinema, you will develop an understanding of the major anxieties, joys, and dilemmas present within the thoughts, livelihoods, and innovations of the early 1900s German-Jewish culture."

One of the other major components of the course was the portfolio, which was helpful but also a bit ambiguous in its purpose. As a place to summarize out-of-class Hebrew experiences (this was my interpretation), I found this helpful, but then I don't understand the point of spending valuable time on formatting rather than the content. I was also seeing different interpretations throughout the class. If this is truly meant to be a ""choose your own adventure"" style of project, I would recommend grading it as such—if people don't think formatting is going to be intellectually stimulating, look to the components they list. If there was a more material realization to the project, I would recommend providing some examples so people can focus their effort on the intellectually-stimulating task at hand."

I know that grammar is obviously an important part of the language, but I think it is also important to learn about things beyond the rules. For example, it would have been cool to have a class on Israeli slang, and see what words and phrases are actually very common in Israel. I also wish we had done a bit more with pop culture. We had a poet come in to speak to us and we read his work, and I really enjoyed that, so I think doing more of that or watching an episode of an Israeli TV show or listening to Israeli songs and talking about them could be very beneficial. Basically, I just think we should have done more that exposed us to real Israeli culture (that would also help with our understanding of the language) than we did."

Whatever I was expecting, though, was not what I was met with. Prof. Baker is very kind, enthusiastic, and fair in her assignments and her grading; that said, we spent the entire semester reviewing grammar forms that I learned in middle school and early high school.While this was a nice review, I can confidently say that I did not learn speak and write any more fluently, did not pick up any slang or the ability to watch fast-paced Hebrew movies, and did not read real Hebrew literature. We worked out of a workbook the entire semester, only read news articles on a platform with small articles meant for Hebrew beginners, and even when we expressed the desire to learn from more applicable sources were not met with engaging, challenging material. Classes were essentially a lecture, with hardly any Hebrew spoken by us. This would have been a good intermediate class, but was definitely not meant to be a 300-level language course."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages).

One of the other major components of the course was the portfolio, which was helpful but also a bit ambiguous in its purpose. As a place to summarize out-of-class Hebrew experiences (this was my interpretation), I found this helpful, but then I don't understand the point of spending valuable time on formatting rather than the content. I was also seeing different interpretations throughout the class. If this is truly meant to be a ""choose your own adventure"" style of project, I would recommend grading it as such—if people don't think formatting is going to be intellectually stimulating, look to the components they list. If there was a more material realization to the project, I would recommend providing some examples so people can focus their effort on the intellectually-stimulating task at hand."

We learned about how natural resource management requires inter-state collaboration that can be challenging in conflict-prone areas, and how such collaboration can be leveraged to further political gain.  We learned about how to use first-hand and narrative sources to trace the development of political ideologies and movements, and how to consider the experiences of individuals in conflict.  We learned, most of all, that the conflict between Israel and Palestine is a deeply complicated one with extensive historical background underlying the actions and motivations of both sides."

It has helped develop the way that I think about religion in a theological context and also has just given me a different viewpoint on history in general because religion has such a pivitol role in history.

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

It has helped develop the way that I think about religion in a theological context and also has just given me a different viewpoint on history in general because religion has such a pivitol role in history.

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

It's definitely the right idea, but sometimes the instructions were vague and the links were hard to find. I would certainly keep these graded readings, and expand on the feedback. The lectures were always excellent and the professors always came OVERLY prepared.

Transforming my worldview & my view of my undergraduate experience—what to prioritize, how to proceed with intentionality. —> Realizing the importance of slowing down & being present.The faculty are incredible. The readings were incredible & helped me reframe the way I thought about how I approached life. Guest speaker conversations (with dinner), especially the one focused on the Israel-Hamas War, really helped me ground reflection into the way I approached politics—it made me realize that religion can't really exist independently of politics, which changed the way I thought about political engagement."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I love the way the course was structured, both the overarching structure of different themes for different groups of stories and the day-to-day structure of reading 1-5 short stories for class, coming to class to discuss in-depth, and then writing a short paper about a handful of these stories later on. I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

By the end of the course, you'll be able to say that you're well-versed in modern European short fiction authors like Kafka, Joyce, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Mann, Sartre, Camus, etc. You get to do some cool out-of-class excursions too, like to the Rare Books library and the Nasher. The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently.

I know that grammar is obviously an important part of the language, but I think it is also important to learn about things beyond the rules. For example, it would have been cool to have a class on Israeli slang, and see what words and phrases are actually very common in Israel. I also wish we had done a bit more with pop culture. We had a poet come in to speak to us and we read his work, and I really enjoyed that, so I think doing more of that or watching an episode of an Israeli TV show or listening to Israeli songs and talking about them could be very beneficial. Basically, I just think we should have done more that exposed us to real Israeli culture (that would also help with our understanding of the language) than we did."

Whatever I was expecting, though, was not what I was met with. Prof. Baker is very kind, enthusiastic, and fair in her assignments and her grading; that said, we spent the entire semester reviewing grammar forms that I learned in middle school and early high school.While this was a nice review, I can confidently say that I did not learn speak and write any more fluently, did not pick up any slang or the ability to watch fast-paced Hebrew movies, and did not read real Hebrew literature. We worked out of a workbook the entire semester, only read news articles on a platform with small articles meant for Hebrew beginners, and even when we expressed the desire to learn from more applicable sources were not met with engaging, challenging material. Classes were essentially a lecture, with hardly any Hebrew spoken by us. This would have been a good intermediate class, but was definitely not meant to be a 300-level language course."

By the end of the course, I felt particularly proud of my improved reading skills. I found the texts to be quite challenging, but ultimately led to immense improvements in my German reading comprehension. I also developed a greater understanding of Jewish-German history and culture in the Modernist time period. I had already consumed some of the media (film and literature mainly) that we discussed in this course, but through our in-depth class discussions, I learned to see these and many new materials through alternative perspectives. It was particularly exciting to discuss the context of different works and ponder the potential implications these contexts could have on the overall meaning of literature, film, and art. Finally, this course helped me develop an understanding of and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of people and ideas. Throughout the course, we saw the connections and overlap between the authors, artists, filmmakers, and philosophers located in Berlin, Prague, and Vienna. It truly made me appreciate and ponder the ways in which information is spread. And, how inspiration is spread as well."

Dr. Gellen was so supportive and recognized that some of the works we discussed in this class were very challenging. She was very understanding and helped guide discussions or explain concepts when we were confused. It also helped that Dr. Gellen is clearly very passionate about the subject which made me excited to learn more and ask questions in class. I thought there was a good balance between papers and presentations. Grading was fair. I also really liked how often we finished the entire assigned reading (either because Dr. Gellen chose shorter works or they were spread out over several class periods). I  think I got more out of the short stories/novellas in particular by reading the entire thing rather than just an excerpt from the story.

I came into this course with very minimal knowledge about Modern German-Jewish history, literature, and culture. This course immersed me completely in the thoughts and ideas of a time period that I had never studied before and taught me to look at works of art and literature through a different lens. Authors and historical figures I was already familiar with, such as Kafka and Freud, took on new significance following our course discussions, and that in itself was incredibly stimulating.

If you do it could be one of the most interesting and fun classes you'll take in your time at Duke. I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

It's definitely the right idea, but sometimes the instructions were vague and the links were hard to find. I would certainly keep these graded readings, and expand on the feedback. The lectures were always excellent and the professors always came OVERLY prepared. It was impressive and refreshing to be taught by professors who had too many slides and could talk for hours on their subject. Don't change a thing about the lectures."
