If you have any questions, make sure to attend office hours before the exam. The class requires both memorization and a solid understanding of the concepts, so starting early is crucial. By reviewing and studying ahead of time, this course can be one of the most interesting and rewarding to take, as it teaches you a lot about human metabolism (especially valuable if you are interested in medical school).
Practice exams are usually posted about a week before the exam. If you start early, you can pace yourself by completing 4–5 practice questions daily, which allows you to finish all the practice exams by Saturday or earlier in the weekend. This will familiarize you with how exams are structured and help you better understand any concepts you find challenging. Also, review the practice questions thoroughly and go over past quizzes from the class(they are incredibly helpful). Finally, take advantage of office hours and do not let anyone scare you into thinking this class is impossible. Yes, it is challenging, but if you start early, it can be one of the most rewarding and enjoyable courses, providing knowledge that will have a lasting impact, especially if you are planning to attend medical school."

However, the slides were fairly minimal, making it tricky to review or grasp the material on our own afterward. As a result, students found themselves taking detailed notes and trying to piece everything together after class, which could be quite a challenge, especially with the fast pace and dense content of the lectures."

I think there is a misconception that if we are not in class that we are not watching the lectures. I am watching and rewatching these lectures and appreciate the accessibility of being able to watch these from my job or watch them at a later date if needed. It allows so much more accessibility. I felt that the lecture style of the class was not very important for me to be there in person while SAGE was important to go in person for due to it's discussion nature. If trying to have more attendance, I would suggest making the class more interactive. Otherwise, lectures with videos are the way to go all the way and is very effective at accommodating everyone with different time management needs."

I appreciated the medical applications that were incorporated in almost every lecture. The ~weekly quizzes were helpful to keep me on track and check my understanding. I didn't always have time for the problem sets, especially toward the end of the semester, but when I did do them, they had some very helpful, detailed problems to test my understanding at the highest level. The exams were very fair for the most part. When I went, SAGE was quite helpful. I am a junior, and this is the first time that I've gone as regularly as I did to SAGE.

It is not easy. There is no textbook so there is really nothing to do in between classes except for the weekly quizzes and problem sets.

Additionally, I think the PSETs are a very helpful part of the course. Sometimes, the information in lecture can be intense or a lot of detailed information all at once, but when we do PSETs, it helps us recognize what is important in the lecture information and how it can be combined to solve problems.

I really did feel that we were learning the deeper information behind concepts we've been taught about in more surface-level ways in previous bio and chem courses, such as allostery or what molecules are important for life. Additionally, we applied and questioned what we learned. Simulations were at times frustrating and many experiments we learned about were new, but this is how we understand scientific articles published about these topics and perform science ourselves. This advanced my skills as a scientist, which is far more important than just learning information. In this sense, I feel that this was an advanced course that built on my past."

It is very detailed, challenges you to think rather than memorize or just absorb, and often moves quickly. I also think the nature of the course being biochemistry means that different parts of the course may be more challenging for certain students; for example, biology majors may encounter more new information in the course section focusing on statistical thermodynamics than chemistry majors, while chemistry majors may encounter more new information on topics like action potential or phospholipid bilayer structure than biology majors. Yet, this course is rewarding. You will learn. This is the point of studying bio/chemistry at Duke - you take difficult but interesting courses and learn from them."

As such, this course is a bit more practical than might be beneficial to someone not working in the cryo EM field. That being said, if you do decide to take it, start on your project early, go to office hours, and ask for help as needed."
