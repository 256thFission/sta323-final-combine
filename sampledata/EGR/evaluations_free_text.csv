If you really want to learn, choose a challenging project, but not a project that will rip your hair out every 30 seconds. Enjoy the tools masteries because that's as good as it's going to get. Grading may vary from instructor but it feels so arbitrary that the rubric might as well not exist. It's just ""No Pass, Low Pass, Pass, High Pass"". That's the least useful thing a student could use and the feedback seems like they didn't consider any challenges we went through. While we certainly could have followed up with our instructor about grading, the grade we received were so demotivating. Stay strong brave soldier. Choose your project wisely and push through it. Expect to not have any weekends available and have someone you can vent to. It's about to be a wild ride!"

Even if you do, still ask for help from peers and professors because engineering is a collaborative process, and I always learned new ways of doing things when I talked to others that improved upon what I thought of by myself. At first, I felt lost in the course because I did not take any engineering classes in high school, so sometimes I had problems that needed more technical knowledge to be solved, and there were materials or techniques to do things that I just did not know existed. I could have solved many of these problems faster if I asked for help earlier. The POD has so many resources, but you won't know any of them are there if you don't ask for help."

Be careful not to become the person who does most of the work, and don't be the person who never volunteers to do anything. Also, get started on prototyping as soon as possible, even if you don't feel like you have everything you need to start. Decide on a design quickly, and start prototyping your design as soon as possible."

My group had several roadblocks that we had to overcome and I liked how we were given free reign to solve them. While we would sometimes ask for help from instructors or lab managers, we were able to solve most problems on our own and we sought out the help when we needed it. This let us figure many things out and allowed for us to develop our individual problem solving and creative skills."

However, once we began prototyping the class became much more fun and I looked forward to each EGR101 class session. I think this was also the appeal of Tools Mastery, since it let us use our creativity on a new tool to create something of our own."

Because of this, my biggest piece of advice is to use the semester as an opportunity to learn as many of these as possible. Many students approach this course believing that the main goal is to produce a successful design, which is not the case. Instead, you should use this semester to capitalize on the opportunities offered by learning all the machines and techniques. These skills will naturally improve your final design, and even if it is not successful, you will leave with a lot more skills than you had previously, which is the biggest success this class has to offer."

I would also tell them to establish group expectations early on and address those early in case of any potential difficulties. I would also tell them to take the advice of everyone in the lab--everyone has a unique perspective, and oftentimes can provide insight to improve a prototype.I would also tell them to get to know the professors and mentors outside of class, since a positive relationship with them will be more conducive to future conversations about feedback. Also, they're amazing mentor figures outside of class, and are happy to talk about life outside of engineering 101."

The course does somewhat help students decide if engineering is a good career idea. However, I am skeptical at how much this class resembles engineering in the real world. Be sure to be interested in the project you choose and have background in it if possible. Ex. if your project includes electronics, try and make sure you understand coding and circuits because you don't really get the opportunity to learn that in class, you will have to rely o your teammates who do have these skills."

However, there were also several times when many members of my group struggled to find ways to contribute. I believe the class could be more stimulating by first limiting groups to a maximum of 4 people and having more frequent check-ins with professors on progress that weren't attached to a grade. This would allow students to be more honest and not feel like they have to pretend things are going well when they haven't been for the sake of their performance in the class."

I do think that there were many times where he could've ""dumbed things down"" a little more, especially for students like me who have never coded before. I do wish he had maybe a word doc with notes of functions/code that we are learning. I know we are meant to takes notes in class but oftentimes it was confusing and I didnt know what I wa meant to take notes on. The hardest part of the semester was the beginning because I didn't know if I was meant to be reading the textbook (and when I did, I didn't understand it). It was also very easy to be discouraged in the class because it seemed like many of my classmates had coded before and I was alone and lost."

The lectures were generally very helpful, however, some were spent entirely on teaching the background science or math rather than focusing on the code. This is not a result of the instructor wasting time, but more so the course itself being based of off concepts that many freshmen have not yet encountered or gained full comprehension of. The labs were always topical, and the style of the primary quiz for the course felt very intuitive for learning. The open/closed book and reflective nature of Skills Quiz 1 took off the pressure of a traditional exam and allowed me to see what my strengths and weaknesses were at that point in the course. Additionally, the reflection let me hone in on an improvement plan, which paid off for the remainder of the course. I highly recommend this style exam for this course, especially since coding is hardly ever done in the real world without additional/external resources. Dr. G also really cares about the well-being of students, and that was very appreciated by me and many others."

Learning the engineering and mathematics with the new programming code was not easy at all.  Since the class combines the 3 aspects, it would be better if the three applications were broken up throughout the semester.  For example, teach the engineering part separate, then cover how to solve the mathematical problem, and lastly how to write it in code.  To make it more intellectually stimulating, videos with explanation and description would be helpful.  It would be helpful to have videos on someone actually doing the code and explaining what it is and why it is done that way.  Videos that show a motion picture or animation of an engineering problem/situation would be beneficial in providing a real example (that the student can deliberately see) of what is going on in a mathematical equation.As a beginner, I had no prior knowledge of Python or any coding software for that matter.  This class felt like treading on cracked ice."

Perhaps a project-based coding class such as this would just work better as a non-intro course, occurring after a basic coding language class has been taken. Additionally, this was the first semester the class has been taught, so I assume many of the imperfections will be smoothed out in the coming semesters."

It went on for a while and by the time we got to actual coding I felt like I didn't have a lot of interest in the class. Some of the assignments just felt like busy-work, as we spent so much time on each small topic when we could have easily gone through so much more so much faster and thus have a more engaging course."

We had 2 extra labs, I did not learn anything new from it and it just took away a lot of my time that I could have spent towards EGR 201 class material. That specific lab assignment was super challenging. Dr. Schaad should consider dropping the extra labs we have. Dr. Schaad also offered an extra credit opportunity to visit a Novus(building downtown) however no transportation was provided, disadvantaging students who could not afford it and wanted to see it. it was optional, however, it wasn't fair to students that wanted to go but couldn't because they didn't had access to transportation.Dr. Schaad struggled to solve problems in lecture and solve problems without looking at the answer key and was confused a lot of the times. I barely learned anything from lectures and often left confused, and had to put most effort by myself to watch YOUTUBE videos outside class and that's what taught me all the concepts, making lectures not so helpful despite me attending them regularly.Dr Schaad should consider changing his way of teaching and lectures  for this specific class to help increase student retention during class and give quality lectures. In comparison to other harder classes, there lectures were a lot better despite them being harder classes.Overall the lecture quality was very poor. Also in comparison to other classes we were assigned two homework assignment and other sections only had 1 hw assignment per week with fewer problems, DR. Schaad should only assign 1 hw assignment per week.Above are some ways Dr. Schaad can use to improve the class."

She also wrote our her notes during lecture instead of reading off of a slideshow. That way, students can keep up with her work and attempt it themselves. She also made us do groupwork so we can practice the material as well. The labs were also pretty relevant to what we were learning in class that week. 1-2 problems were assigned for homework for each lecture which ensured we kept up with the course material, as well as extra practice material for quizzes. Instead of midterms, we had 5 quizzes and if we didn't score well enough, Dr. Bansal was very generous and would allow us to retake the quiz after proving mastery of that skill.

She never made me feel silly for asking questions, and seemed to genuinely care whether or not I understood the fundamentals. I appreciate that she pushed us to always do the best work we possibly could, while holding us highly accountable for using AI or outside resources that might impede our learning in the long term. I also very much appreciated that she posted lecture recordings--I feel that some professors avoid this in order to retain class attendance, but I think because Dr. B has a hefty participation grade incorporated into the Syllabus, people didn't miss class.

This class format was the best I've seen during my time at Duke, and I think we should keep it for future years. Each lecture was structured around one topic, then we did a group problem discussing the same topic. Then, for the homework, the main question was about the lecture topic but we had to use knowledge from prior weeks to solve it.

I felt that the labs strayed a bit away from what was being taught in class and just sort of made for extra work, but they were still pretty interesting and it was a good introduction to engineering labs.

That is not to say that others did not enjoy it much more than I.
My usual experience was as follows: A derivation is performed which I, and most others, get lost during. Then there is a simple formula at the end which we memorize, having little idea as to why exactly it is used. That is our fault, as we could of course read the book or really try to delve into these derivations, but there is no incentive nor inspired desire to understand them.Once again, I think more enthusiasm from the speaker would help remedy this. I know that the speaker probably does find the subject at least somewhat interesting, but he does not show it.

I liked that tests in this class were used as a tool to gauge the students' understanding, and then we were given a chance to make sure that if we'd missed stuff, we would learn it by doing the corrections. This also made it much easier to keep up with the material and make sure I knew everything we had covered up to the exam.

The numerical methods practice in the homework was very interesting and taught not only how to numerically solve equations, but how to code systems and visualize them. The labs are also pretty interesting, and the lab report format is a good combination of analytical and programming work -- but usually, there is too much other work assigned in the class in the same period of time (homework AND a quiz correction) that sufficient time cannot be devoted to the lab, and instead it is seen as just another assignment to complete.

I had to work closely with many other people in the class, which I enjoyed, but also added a level of difficulty to completing some of the assignments. Since we had a few extra lectures at the end of the semester, I would have loved to learn a little bit more about current research projects or other ways in which the subject we've been learning in class directly tie in to the work being done around us."

One thing in particular is that there were no rubrics for the labs or project which made the grading feel a bit arbitary and left us unsure about what exactly we needed to do. Half the battle is just finding out what we need to do and I feel like this made things unnecesarily difficult. I feel that the difficulty should come from challenging ourselves with concepts and not figuring out the details of a vague lab manual."

Her mastery of the subject is a clear and is certainly an asset in the structure of this course. Demonstrating more complicated/non-intuitive using apparatus that was brought to class was extremely helpful. The videos/prompt google searches were also great.

In the future, I would keep the lab component, but possibly discuss the implications of the lab in class to make sure the learning from it was as efficient as possible. I found the many office hours sections incredibly helpful throughout the course, and often went multiple times every week. I would keep the open-notes, group structure of the quizzes and labs as I found this very helpful.

While I think this class is very worthwhile and I really liked the professor, so much of the class was just trying to get the work done instead of actually learning it. Many of my classmates found this class to be simply draining because it was so difficult to complete, let alone do well on, all the assignments within the allotted time.

She makes the lab reports insanely difficult (as in 50+ pages which take days to complete). The coding requirements are unrealistic, and the material learned from the labs is minimal. However, Dr. Dowell is very kind and helpful in office hours. He is a good lecturer and welcomes any questions. I definitely feel like I learned less than the other section though."

If you need structure in your classes, I would recommend taking Dynamics with another professor. The disorganization of this class probably caused me more stress than taking the other section which was inarguably more difficult."

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter.

The real-world feel of the class was something I had been craving out of school my whole life. You can't look up the answers to this class on Chegg! You have to look in the real world! This was incredibly an incredibly stimulating aspect.How could it be more intellectually stimulating:
More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments. If we had, there would have been more opportunity for intellectual stimulation."

The real-world feel of the class was something I had been craving out of school my whole life. You can't look up the answers to this class on Chegg! You have to look in the real world! This was incredibly an incredibly stimulating aspect.How could it be more intellectually stimulating:
More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments. If we had, there would have been more opportunity for intellectual stimulation."

I already had a strong grasp of the concepts presented and, in many cases, a deeper understanding from practical experience. As someone who has participated in hiring processes, managed a team, and hired multiple people, I had very minimal takeaways from this course.At times, it felt unnecessary to be in class, as I could have been working on more advanced or nuanced aspects of the subject. While I understand that this course may have been helpful for others in my cohort, I feel there would be value in dividing students into tailored groups based on experience and familiarity with the topic. This would allow us to build on our current knowledge more effectively, rather than being placed in cohorts with varying levels of understanding."

While the course extensively covered resume building and LinkedIn profiles, dedicating some time to cover letter creation would be beneficial.

It would be helpful to recognize that students have varying learning styles (e.g., extrovert and introvert student). Some may thrive in interactive warm-up activities, while others might prefer a more structured approach. Offering a balance or allowing students to choose between different approaches could make the course even more inclusive.(3) Advanced Professional Development 
Given the success of this course, considering more advanced coursework could be a valuable next step. Topics could include understanding U.S. working culture, assessing job offers comprehensively, and negotiating compensation packages.

Talking with your neighbor about the Gallup big 5 strengths is not intellectual conversation. Almost every time this happened, which was a lot, it was always unserious. Remove the focus on the strengths or actually dig into it more. Its so surface level there is really no thought into that. Back on the group discussion, things like that and other group discussions like work in your groups on these ideas were a waste of time. Again it was not serious. The class was too large in my opinion. You need to decrease the size for it to really make an impact. The lack of impactful assignments also was not great. The big four assignments should be a requirement for completion of the course, more assignments should be incorporated, and they shouldn't be for completion but actually some sort of loose grading component so there actual stake.If we are going to do the big classes with group discussion. Make assigned seating or something, so unique conversation forms each class."

I found that by listening actively and being receptive to feedback, I could refine my understanding and enhance my skills. This mindset encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone, whether it was experimenting with unfamiliar problem-solving techniques or engaging in discussions that challenged my viewpoints. 
Learning to practice gratitude helped me recognize and appreciate the value in everyday experiences, both big and small. Whether it was acknowledging the effort of a teammate or being thankful for feedback, this perspective allowed me to focus on positive outcomes, even in challenging situations.
Embracing vulnerability taught me the strength in admitting when I don’t know something or need help.This approach also helped me connect with peers and instructors on a more personal level, creating a supportive learning environment."

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments.

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments.

The real-world feel of the class was something I had been craving out of school my whole life. You can't look up the answers to this class on Chegg! You have to look in the real world! This was incredibly an incredibly stimulating aspect.How could it be more intellectually stimulating:
More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments. If we had, there would have been more opportunity for intellectual stimulation."

They were intellectually stimulating. However, they could've been better with some more time."

We often find ourselves confused and frustrated as to why we're doing an assignment at this time because we haven't laid the groundwork for it (e.g., we're asked to do an assignment that assumes a solution when we haven't done enough research to understand the problem and ideate a solution)."

If you're only interested in building cool technical devices, this class may not be the best fit for you. However, if you want to create something meaningful from scratch—designing a product that addresses a user's pain point—then this is the perfect class for you."

If you are looking to learn about a specific clean technology, whether it be related to renewable energy, infrastructure adaptation, sustainable materials, or sustainable business, it will not be taught to you. Further if you would like to apply engineering design, mechanical/electrical/chemical/computer engineering concepts, or any other area of academia, you will have to seek it out yourself. These realities, however, do reflect the real world. Just know what to expect."

We are students at the end of the day, so we are juggling many other things besides this course. Be mindful of the time commitment and only take this course when your other work is less intense. Or if you are extremely passionate about one of the projects."
