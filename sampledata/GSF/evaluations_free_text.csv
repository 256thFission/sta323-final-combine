2. How external conditions can cause disability (like gangs) 
3. Cultural/shared disability was very interesting, especially when in the context of the Gaza conflict"

(For example, I honestly had NO idea that black women slaves were the unwilling subjects who gave us the practice of gynecology we have today.) I also learned how to digest large readings and get the main takeaways as we discussed them during class. As a cis white woman, I do want to mention how I came into this class not having a ton of background on these subjects and I now have learned so much that I will apply in the medical field - like taking into account the history of practices, understanding how livelihoods and backgrounds should be considered, and understanding how my own biases could impact my work on any individual."

She is astoundingly brilliant on all fronts, has thought a lot about the topic of hope, and genuinely cares about what your thoughts are on the readings. Her reading-recaps are beyond helpful (she takes dense readings and makes them actually digestible), she is always able to answer questions, and she too applies the thinkers that we learned about early on in the semester on a daily basis. Professor Allison is a major component for why this class was so amazing and I think that she really went above and beyond to facilitate learning, engagement, and understanding in her class. Further, I think that she organized the class in a very intentional way. It was very smart to have thinkers first, then medicine, home, and finally disaster. She clearly thought about the structure of the course and every reading that we did / how it would weave together into conversations in class -- and I really commend her for how it played out throughout the semester. Professor Allison was also extremely available for help outside of class (I personally met with her a bunch) and she was overwhelmingly helpful each time. Finally, I really have appreciated the thought that goes into paper prompts because they prompt critical thinking that is engaging, intellectual, but also fun and enjoyable. Her and Anton did a great job with this -- serious kudos to them."

- Try to really understand all the thinkers that you learn about in the first unit because they will all come up in conversation throughout the rest of the course and doing this would create a foundation to make the rest of the class easier.
- Just have fun with it! it is challenging but incredibly rewarding. You don't need to understand everything fully, just try your best
- Start your essays as early as possible - the prompts are long and really thought-provoking, which means leaving it to the last minute is not really possible
- Also meet with professor Allison outside of class! She really is the best!"

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I completely changed my reading style throughout this course.  We had to tackle a lot of challenging texts, but I think the order in which we completed them made sense because we had to use the concepts as perspectives for future readings.  It was an interesting anthropological course, something I was not used to, we did not do a lot of field work and creating our own ethnographic work, nor did we solely read ethnographic material.  I did not expect this, but I have started to apply the tools we learned in this class on reading and discussing as well as the key concepts and developing ideas in other courses.  In summary, I learned how to go through readings differently and apply new perspectives for future readings as well as connect these to other readings with my own concept I create such as we did in the papers and finally talk through and relearn a reading in a way I did not originally do such as we did in Winart."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Namakkal created a strong learning environment overall. She is genuinely one of the most knowledgeable professors I’ve ever had—she seems to have deep insight into every part of the world. Her lectures were intellectually engaging, and she had a great ability to connect themes across time and space, which made the material more meaningful. However, the structure of the lectures was sometimes confusing. We had two lectures a week and one discussion, but many of the lectures felt more like unstructured conversations where students were asked to share personal opinions/views on topics. I often got lost in the material because I prefer more structured lectures where the professor speaks and explains key ideas clearly, followed by space for questions. The discussions should be the space for student participation, not the lectures. In fact, one of the most effective classes was when we had a guest speaker who delivered a full lecture without turning it into a discussion—I found that format much easier to follow and more informative.Professor Gasparowicz is a very sweet and kind professor, and she was also my discussion leader. However, her lectures were often difficult to follow. She seemed unprepared at times and made factual mistakes that Professor Namakkal had to correct. Her slides mostly consisted of long quotes that we had to read aloud and then discuss with a partner, which didn’t feel like real teaching. Unfortunately, I don’t remember much from her lectures, even though I believe she is knowledgeable. That said, she was more effective as a discussion leader, and I felt more engaged in our smaller discussion group than during her lectures. It honestly breaks my heart to write this and be a little harsh, because she is such a kind person—but I also have high expectations from Duke professors, and unfortunately, my expectations weren’t fulfilled in her lectures. In terms of grading, she was also the one evaluating my reading responses, and that was another area of difficulty. Her feedback was often vague and filled with grammar mistakes, which made it hard to understand what she actually wanted from me. Even by the end of the semester, I didn’t know what the grading criteria were and every new grade was a complete surprise. Comments like “explain” or “how?” weren’t helpful—especially for a freshman still learning how to write in college. With a strict 250-word limit, it’s hard to know what “explain” means when space is so limited. When I compared feedback with other students in different discussion groups, I noticed the grading was very inconsistent. It felt extremely subjective, which made the whole process more frustrating than helpful. Clearer rubrics and more objective, consistent grading across TAs would definitely improve the course."

Like looking SAP in Jamaica, or developing an idea of modern day imperialism, and dismantling development theory, which many developed nations use to justify their actions. We were able to see past the arguments of politicians in power that use the surface level argument. 
Sometimes the guest speakers were a bit boring and not easy to keep up with. 
The reading responses were also hard to get a hang of. I would have appreciated an example of a good reading response from the beginning, I think it would have allowed me to do better on my first couple of reading responses. 
Although the midterm was a lot to study for, it definitely felt easier than the reading responses, as I generally like to explain a lot, so it is a good balance for people who may be used to writing a lot compared to the reading responses which were more difficult for me."

I liked guest speakers who came in, it helped stimulate us as we got used to the class set up. I also appreciated the structure of the class. Nothing was a surprise (weekly reading responses, counter map, and 2 tests).

That process helped me develop critical thinking skills. However, the intense focus on colonialism made the course feel somewhat one-sided and repetitive. Including more diverse perspectives—both politically and topically—would have added depth and balance.

If you're hoping to focus on current global issues, you may find the emphasis on colonialism throughout the semester limiting. The main component of the class is writing—especially the weekly reading responses—which can be challenging and is graded strictly. While the course is officially about global issues, in practice it felt more like a writing class with a cross-cultural inquiry tag. That said, it’s a valuable experience for improving your writing and learning to engage critically with texts. Just be prepared for the writing component to take center stage."

There is not any other room really to insert different opinions, and if you are Jewish, they will attack Israel, and you will feel slightly uncomfortable. They are all based on their political opinions, and you will see that very clearly, and that is how you learn the class. I did absolutely love the discussion element of the class and I think the teacher/Ta does really care about the students. Some of the readings were wildly boring but the reading responses and CCLEs were fun and helpful to write. I don't think there is enough challenging of perspectives though in this class."

That being said, I definitely learned how to read lengthy texts and vastly different narrative/literature styles more efficiently, which is a useful skill for all of my courses at Duke to come. I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Needless to say, I found myself questioning the most foundational beliefs I have held for most of my life and while it was disorienting at times, especially because of the unconventional dialogue we worked with, the support of the instructors at office hours, particularly Professor Mathers and Melissa Karp, made understanding, reconciling with, and applying those difficult conversations much more manageable and understandable.

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

That being said, I definitely learned how to read lengthy texts and vastly different narrative/literature styles more efficiently, which is a useful skill for all of my courses at Duke to come. I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

I tend to rumble, so it was very hard (and annoying) at first. But over time, I've gotten the hang of it and even grown to appreciate the skill.2. I've learnt a great deal of classic ideas in academia. Some I had heard of before but didn't understand, like Said's Orientalism, and some were completely new like Liboiron's Pollution is Colonialism. In all cases, the class provided very useful,  interesting and unique ways of understanding the world. Going beyond just understanding these classic ideas in the contexts they were written, the class provided multiple opportunities to apply and understand these ideas as they relate to the world today. The Reading responses and Op-Ed, for example, were great opportunities to link an academic concept to an issue we care about. I've learnt so much from my peers as well. I look forward to including more of Fanon and Cesaire's ideas in my anti-colonial discourse, Liboiron when discussing the environment and Orientalism when discussing Hollywood's next appropriating blockbuster.3. In thinking about the four essential questions of this course, I have thought a lot about myself and my placement in the globalising world. I have done many an internal deep dive about the ways in which my experiences have shaped the way I view the world. I've found myself asking what my personal relationship with capitalism and colonialism is, for example. I've thought a lot more deeply than usually do about Zambia where I'm from and how neoliberalism, for example, has permeated our society in interesting ways. What do I do that contributes to the climate crisis? What can I do differently? How do I hold others accountable? What do I care about? What am I committed to?

That being said, I definitely learned how to read lengthy texts and vastly different narrative/literature styles more efficiently, which is a useful skill for all of my courses at Duke to come. I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Namakkal created a strong learning environment overall. She is genuinely one of the most knowledgeable professors I’ve ever had—she seems to have deep insight into every part of the world. Her lectures were intellectually engaging, and she had a great ability to connect themes across time and space, which made the material more meaningful. However, the structure of the lectures was sometimes confusing. We had two lectures a week and one discussion, but many of the lectures felt more like unstructured conversations where students were asked to share personal opinions/views on topics. I often got lost in the material because I prefer more structured lectures where the professor speaks and explains key ideas clearly, followed by space for questions. The discussions should be the space for student participation, not the lectures. In fact, one of the most effective classes was when we had a guest speaker who delivered a full lecture without turning it into a discussion—I found that format much easier to follow and more informative.Professor Gasparowicz is a very sweet and kind professor, and she was also my discussion leader. However, her lectures were often difficult to follow. She seemed unprepared at times and made factual mistakes that Professor Namakkal had to correct. Her slides mostly consisted of long quotes that we had to read aloud and then discuss with a partner, which didn’t feel like real teaching. Unfortunately, I don’t remember much from her lectures, even though I believe she is knowledgeable. That said, she was more effective as a discussion leader, and I felt more engaged in our smaller discussion group than during her lectures. It honestly breaks my heart to write this and be a little harsh, because she is such a kind person—but I also have high expectations from Duke professors, and unfortunately, my expectations weren’t fulfilled in her lectures. In terms of grading, she was also the one evaluating my reading responses, and that was another area of difficulty. Her feedback was often vague and filled with grammar mistakes, which made it hard to understand what she actually wanted from me. Even by the end of the semester, I didn’t know what the grading criteria were and every new grade was a complete surprise. Comments like “explain” or “how?” weren’t helpful—especially for a freshman still learning how to write in college. With a strict 250-word limit, it’s hard to know what “explain” means when space is so limited. When I compared feedback with other students in different discussion groups, I noticed the grading was very inconsistent. It felt extremely subjective, which made the whole process more frustrating than helpful. Clearer rubrics and more objective, consistent grading across TAs would definitely improve the course."

The in-class lectures were engaging but the whole semester I was thinking about everything that is happening in the real world yet we didn't address that at all. I recommend connecting readings/concepts to present day issues next time.

It also challenged the ways we previously would learn about history and global politics in high school settings (eg in a very Eurocentric manner). As a student activist myself I really appreciated that this was a constant focus in the classroom.

Like looking SAP in Jamaica, or developing an idea of modern day imperialism, and dismantling development theory, which many developed nations use to justify their actions. We were able to see past the arguments of politicians in power that use the surface level argument. 
Sometimes the guest speakers were a bit boring and not easy to keep up with. 
The reading responses were also hard to get a hang of. I would have appreciated an example of a good reading response from the beginning, I think it would have allowed me to do better on my first couple of reading responses. 
Although the midterm was a lot to study for, it definitely felt easier than the reading responses, as I generally like to explain a lot, so it is a good balance for people who may be used to writing a lot compared to the reading responses which were more difficult for me."

However, I noticed a trend towards the end that consistently continued to bring up a form of liberalism or colonialism. While these are deeply engaging topics, I felt as if the course is quite concentrated on these two issues, and was more about them than a breadth of what is going on in the world."

I appreciated that if you disliked a unit it only lasted a week (except proletariat and bourgeoisie, that seemed to last forever and would recommend cutting back on how much you discuss that). I liked guest speakers who came in, it helped stimulate us as we got used to the class set up. I also appreciated the structure of the class. Nothing was a surprise (weekly reading responses, counter map, and 2 tests). The class could be more stimulating if we didn't just summarize readings in lecture, which it sometimes felt that's what we did. Readings could be significantly shorter."

That process helped me develop critical thinking skills. However, the intense focus on colonialism made the course feel somewhat one-sided and repetitive. Including more diverse perspectives—both politically and topically—would have added depth and balance. Some students may find the political leaning of the course very liberal, and it might be difficult for those with different viewpoints to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts."

Notes to improve the class:
I personally felt very self-conscious of what to say in class often. I was afraid of saying the wrong thing and being judged or canceled for it. I think the class can really benefit from frequent reminders to express oneself as long as we're intending to learn and we're driven by curiosity. The philosopher J. S. Mill says that the controversial statements and questions are those that get us closer to truth, make us improve our arguments, and prevent dead dogmas. So I really want this class to cultivate the courage for everyone to speak their mind more openly without worrying about consequences."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Through this course, I developed (and fine-tuned) filmmaking, editing, and software skills by curating student-led film projects in collaboration with community partners in the Triangle area. I gained insights from course texts that engaged with queer and feminist theory, developing new ways of thinking about the current climate crisis, of being in relation with one another, and how (both tangibly and theoretically) to live and embody these concepts (not just read, think, and write about them). I learned how to work collaboratively on a long-term creative project in such a way that builds on our individual and collective strengths. I explored new elements of our relationship to our environment, from our biological traits to the science behind our gut-brain connection."

From our visits to the Duke Campus Farm, I learned about the farm's history and also engaged with specific practices including mulching, weeding, and broad-forking.

I always felt excited going to class because we were doing something new and talking about something meaningful, which expanded my broader knowledge of climate, justice, and their intersection.

As I head into senior year and speak with past seniors, I’m thinking more about what I want to take with me from Duke. For me, that means building deeper relationships and being more present in the community I’ve lived in for four years. This class helped me start doing that."

The class does not require a lot of work but is rewarding to be a part of nonetheless, and the readings and pieces we examine are so interesting!"

So really not too bad at all in terms of workload. Readings, on average, take no more than 3 hours per week."

Professors Gelfand and Henschel cultivated a space where theory and practice met in meaningful ways. The combination of seminar-style discussions, creative media assignments (One Minute videos, Zine workshop), and collaborative final projects allowed for a multifaceted learning experience that accommodated a wide range of learning styles.For future years, I would strongly recommend keeping the combination of theory-based readings, digital production, and the reflective essay as core pillars of the course."

3. I learned about the utter importance of teaching people how to act as a collective, rather than build isolated boxes around people with different ideas and beliefs. So often today, people judge each other without even truly knowing each other, based on a general idea of who they think they are. We are judged by society's perceptions of ourselves, and sometimes it's hard to bridge this gap—but it's essential for us to find common ground with each other if we are to make meaningful change."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This class gave me a new perspective on neoliberal hyper focus on identity and the purification of those categories, like cis and trans. It also gave me a new way of thinking about the role of the state in the creation and maintenance of things like sex and race, and also how medicolegal processes formed those as inseparable identifications. It was also really interesting to learn about non normative gendered subjects in Weimar/Nazi Germany and   (post) dictatorship Argentina and how fascist persecution is not homogeneous and relies in part on economic utility to the state."

1) How ""trans"" goes beyond just individuals that identify as transgender (and how this conceptualization of transgender as relegated to personal identity is a more recent idea, and may not be how trans actually functions in the world today)
2) How biological sex is a more complicated and political topic than a previously thought, especially (but not limited to) how it and its relation to gender are racialized

I think the topics of the two short papers and the freedom of the last one were good and I felt pushed to think more deeply about complicated and difficult to answer questions in trans studies.

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class. Take this course esepcially if you want to read more and read these types of texts and engage with them in a relaxed and growth-centered manner but dont have the time in your personal life or other classes to do so.

I think perhaps requiring that students fulfill a prereq before enrolling in the class or submitting a paragraph explaining why they are interested to ensure that everyone who is in the class is generally on the same level to allow for more meaningful and intellectually stimulating conversations.

She is astoundingly brilliant on all fronts, has thought a lot about the topic of hope, and genuinely cares about what your thoughts are on the readings. Her reading-recaps are beyond helpful (she takes dense readings and makes them actually digestible), she is always able to answer questions, and she too applies the thinkers that we learned about early on in the semester on a daily basis. Professor Allison is a major component for why this class was so amazing and I think that she really went above and beyond to facilitate learning, engagement, and understanding in her class. Further, I think that she organized the class in a very intentional way. It was very smart to have thinkers first, then medicine, home, and finally disaster. She clearly thought about the structure of the course and every reading that we did / how it would weave together into conversations in class -- and I really commend her for how it played out throughout the semester. Professor Allison was also extremely available for help outside of class (I personally met with her a bunch) and she was overwhelmingly helpful each time. Finally, I really have appreciated the thought that goes into paper prompts because they prompt critical thinking that is engaging, intellectual, but also fun and enjoyable.

- Just have fun with it! it is challenging but incredibly rewarding. You don't need to understand everything fully, just try your best
- Start your essays as early as possible - the prompts are long and really thought-provoking, which means leaving it to the last minute is not really possible

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

The text activation was also valuable in making me thing of alternative ways to engage with academic texts and rethink the role of the body in academic spaces."

I did not expect this, but I have started to apply the tools we learned in this class on reading and discussing as well as the key concepts and developing ideas in other courses.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Namakkal created a strong learning environment overall. She is genuinely one of the most knowledgeable professors I’ve ever had—she seems to have deep insight into every part of the world. Her lectures were intellectually engaging, and she had a great ability to connect themes across time and space, which made the material more meaningful. However, the structure of the lectures was sometimes confusing. We had two lectures a week and one discussion, but many of the lectures felt more like unstructured conversations where students were asked to share personal opinions/views on topics. I often got lost in the material because I prefer more structured lectures where the professor speaks and explains key ideas clearly, followed by space for questions. The discussions should be the space for student participation, not the lectures. In fact, one of the most effective classes was when we had a guest speaker who delivered a full lecture without turning it into a discussion—I found that format much easier to follow and more informative.Professor Gasparowicz is a very sweet and kind professor, and she was also my discussion leader. However, her lectures were often difficult to follow. She seemed unprepared at times and made factual mistakes that Professor Namakkal had to correct. Her slides mostly consisted of long quotes that we had to read aloud and then discuss with a partner, which didn’t feel like real teaching. Unfortunately, I don’t remember much from her lectures, even though I believe she is knowledgeable. That said, she was more effective as a discussion leader, and I felt more engaged in our smaller discussion group than during her lectures. It honestly breaks my heart to write this and be a little harsh, because she is such a kind person—but I also have high expectations from Duke professors, and unfortunately, my expectations weren’t fulfilled in her lectures. In terms of grading, she was also the one evaluating my reading responses, and that was another area of difficulty. Her feedback was often vague and filled with grammar mistakes, which made it hard to understand what she actually wanted from me. Even by the end of the semester, I didn’t know what the grading criteria were and every new grade was a complete surprise. Comments like “explain” or “how?” weren’t helpful—especially for a freshman still learning how to write in college. With a strict 250-word limit, it’s hard to know what “explain” means when space is so limited. When I compared feedback with other students in different discussion groups, I noticed the grading was very inconsistent. It felt extremely subjective, which made the whole process more frustrating than helpful. Clearer rubrics and more objective, consistent grading across TAs would definitely improve the course."

Like looking SAP in Jamaica, or developing an idea of modern day imperialism, and dismantling development theory, which many developed nations use to justify their actions. We were able to see past the arguments of politicians in power that use the surface level argument. 
Sometimes the guest speakers were a bit boring and not easy to keep up with. 
The reading responses were also hard to get a hang of. I would have appreciated an example of a good reading response from the beginning, I think it would have allowed me to do better on my first couple of reading responses. 
Although the midterm was a lot to study for, it definitely felt easier than the reading responses, as I generally like to explain a lot, so it is a good balance for people who may be used to writing a lot compared to the reading responses which were more difficult for me."

If you're hoping to focus on current global issues, you may find the emphasis on colonialism throughout the semester limiting. The main component of the class is writing—especially the weekly reading responses—which can be challenging and is graded strictly. While the course is officially about global issues, in practice it felt more like a writing class with a cross-cultural inquiry tag. That said, it’s a valuable experience for improving your writing and learning to engage critically with texts. Just be prepared for the writing component to take center stage."

There is not any other room really to insert different opinions, and if you are Jewish, they will attack Israel, and you will feel slightly uncomfortable. They are all based on their political opinions, and you will see that very clearly, and that is how you learn the class. I did absolutely love the discussion element of the class and I think the teacher/Ta does really care about the students. Some of the readings were wildly boring but the reading responses and CCLEs were fun and helpful to write. I don't think there is enough challenging of perspectives though in this class."

That being said, I definitely learned how to read lengthy texts and vastly different narrative/literature styles more efficiently, which is a useful skill for all of my courses at Duke to come. I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

She would make connections in the texts that I had not thought of before and her personal accounts were instructing. By far one of the best TA's I've had and was extremely engaged with our class and each student. Aided in my writing skills as well and working to create texts that were concise but not just summarizing."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Oftentimes students have different learning styles and devoting an entire class time to talking and slides isn't the most engaging. The discussion sections were much more stimulating, and aspects of the active participation activities done in this discussion could've made the class more stimulating had they been implemented in the big lecture classes."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

I tend to rumble, so it was very hard (and annoying) at first. But over time, I've gotten the hang of it and even grown to appreciate the skill.2. I've learnt a great deal of classic ideas in academia. Some I had heard of before but didn't understand, like Said's Orientalism, and some were completely new like Liboiron's Pollution is Colonialism. In all cases, the class provided very useful,  interesting and unique ways of understanding the world. Going beyond just understanding these classic ideas in the contexts they were written, the class provided multiple opportunities to apply and understand these ideas as they relate to the world today. The Reading responses and Op-Ed, for example, were great opportunities to link an academic concept to an issue we care about. I've learnt so much from my peers as well. I look forward to including more of Fanon and Cesaire's ideas in my anti-colonial discourse, Liboiron when discussing the environment and Orientalism when discussing Hollywood's next appropriating blockbuster.3. In thinking about the four essential questions of this course, I have thought a lot about myself and my placement in the globalising world. I have done many an internal deep dive about the ways in which my experiences have shaped the way I view the world. I've found myself asking what my personal relationship with capitalism and colonialism is, for example. I've thought a lot more deeply than usually do about Zambia where I'm from and how neoliberalism, for example, has permeated our society in interesting ways. What do I do that contributes to the climate crisis? What can I do differently? How do I hold others accountable? What do I care about? What am I committed to? This class has provided many opportunities for reflection, and I am better for it."

That being said, I definitely learned how to read lengthy texts and vastly different narrative/literature styles more efficiently, which is a useful skill for all of my courses at Duke to come. I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Oftentimes students have different learning styles and devoting an entire class time to talking and slides isn't the most engaging. The discussion sections were much more stimulating, and aspects of the active participation activities done in this discussion could've made the class more stimulating had they been implemented in the big lecture classes."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

That being said, I definitely learned how to read lengthy texts and vastly different narrative/literature styles more efficiently, which is a useful skill for all of my courses at Duke to come. I also learned how to think more critically about texts -- I might not have understood everything that was taught to the fullest extent, but critiquing it, I have learned, is a fundamental start towards understanding it. Lastly, learning how to write succinctly but powerfully was also a challenging and very valuable part of the course. Many of our writing assignments had hard word limits, which is difficult to implement when you're reading many of these philosophical-style texts that are so information-dense, but I definitely had to force myself to see which parts of my writing were necessary and which parts were not, and how to word/arrange their content more eloquently and succinctly."

Some of the readings were very stimulating, like Said's Orientalism for example, however these readings were just kind of tossed in with a bunch of other readings on other topics that in my view never came together as one cohesive unit. We would read Marx one week explaining what a commodity is and how it's harmful, and the next week would be reading about how climate change disproportionately affects countries in the periphery. It just felt very disjointed. 
The smaller group discussions were stimulating because I felt that's really where the only real discussions could take place. The main group class has a lot of kids which can feel intimidating or difficult to make contributions to, and as I mentioned earlier, the fact that the professor often just shut down students' ideas made this worse. Personally I am stimulated by making contributions to big groups and am not afraid of it and enjoy controversy, but I think the learning environment in the big class group was challenging for some to feel they could comfortably contribute."

While many are inclined to see ICS as a very niche humanities major (including myself, as an Environmental Science major), I cannot underscore how widely applicable this class is, both in professional fields and better understanding literally how everything within our society works. It can feel very abstract at times, but the content is based around theories and concepts that are so universally fundamental - like capitalism, colonialism, the origins of nationalism, accumulation of wealth - it would be extremely difficult to sit through ICS196 and feel like you haven't learned anything applicable. Also, I think you really learn the most when you go into classes like these assuming you don't know everything. If I had assumed all my preconceived notions were indefinitely correct, I would have felt like I did not learn anything, but being open to new, radical perspectives is essential. ICS195 was also not an easy class, both work load wise and intellectually, but the instructors always gave me support and direction when I needed it. I enjoyed ICS so much I'm considering double majoring in both ENVS and ICS."

Second, it pushed me to think critically about international institutions that claim to serve humanitarian goals but often operate in exploitative ways. Finally, the introduction to basic political theory at the start of the semester laid a strong foundation for understanding the more complex global issues we explored later in the course."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Namakkal created a strong learning environment overall. She is genuinely one of the most knowledgeable professors I’ve ever had—she seems to have deep insight into every part of the world. Her lectures were intellectually engaging, and she had a great ability to connect themes across time and space, which made the material more meaningful. However, the structure of the lectures was sometimes confusing. We had two lectures a week and one discussion, but many of the lectures felt more like unstructured conversations where students were asked to share personal opinions/views on topics. I often got lost in the material because I prefer more structured lectures where the professor speaks and explains key ideas clearly, followed by space for questions. The discussions should be the space for student participation, not the lectures. In fact, one of the most effective classes was when we had a guest speaker who delivered a full lecture without turning it into a discussion—I found that format much easier to follow and more informative.Professor Gasparowicz is a very sweet and kind professor, and she was also my discussion leader. However, her lectures were often difficult to follow. She seemed unprepared at times and made factual mistakes that Professor Namakkal had to correct. Her slides mostly consisted of long quotes that we had to read aloud and then discuss with a partner, which didn’t feel like real teaching. Unfortunately, I don’t remember much from her lectures, even though I believe she is knowledgeable. That said, she was more effective as a discussion leader, and I felt more engaged in our smaller discussion group than during her lectures. It honestly breaks my heart to write this and be a little harsh, because she is such a kind person—but I also have high expectations from Duke professors, and unfortunately, my expectations weren’t fulfilled in her lectures. In terms of grading, she was also the one evaluating my reading responses, and that was another area of difficulty. Her feedback was often vague and filled with grammar mistakes, which made it hard to understand what she actually wanted from me. Even by the end of the semester, I didn’t know what the grading criteria were and every new grade was a complete surprise. Comments like “explain” or “how?” weren’t helpful—especially for a freshman still learning how to write in college. With a strict 250-word limit, it’s hard to know what “explain” means when space is so limited. When I compared feedback with other students in different discussion groups, I noticed the grading was very inconsistent. It felt extremely subjective, which made the whole process more frustrating than helpful. Clearer rubrics and more objective, consistent grading across TAs would definitely improve the course."

It also challenged the ways we previously would learn about history and global politics in high school settings (eg in a very Eurocentric manner). As a student activist myself I really appreciated that this was a constant focus in the classroom.

Like looking SAP in Jamaica, or developing an idea of modern day imperialism, and dismantling development theory, which many developed nations use to justify their actions. We were able to see past the arguments of politicians in power that use the surface level argument. 
Sometimes the guest speakers were a bit boring and not easy to keep up with. 
The reading responses were also hard to get a hang of. I would have appreciated an example of a good reading response from the beginning, I think it would have allowed me to do better on my first couple of reading responses. 
Although the midterm was a lot to study for, it definitely felt easier than the reading responses, as I generally like to explain a lot, so it is a good balance for people who may be used to writing a lot compared to the reading responses which were more difficult for me."

However, I noticed a trend towards the end that consistently continued to bring up a form of liberalism or colonialism. While these are deeply engaging topics, I felt as if the course is quite concentrated on these two issues, and was more about them than a breadth of what is going on in the world."

I appreciated that if you disliked a unit it only lasted a week (except proletariat and bourgeoisie, that seemed to last forever and would recommend cutting back on how much you discuss that). I liked guest speakers who came in, it helped stimulate us as we got used to the class set up. I also appreciated the structure of the class. Nothing was a surprise (weekly reading responses, counter map, and 2 tests). The class could be more stimulating if we didn't just summarize readings in lecture, which it sometimes felt that's what we did. Readings could be significantly shorter."

That process helped me develop critical thinking skills. However, the intense focus on colonialism made the course feel somewhat one-sided and repetitive. Including more diverse perspectives—both politically and topically—would have added depth and balance. Some students may find the political leaning of the course very liberal, and it might be difficult for those with different viewpoints to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts."

If you're hoping to focus on current global issues, you may find the emphasis on colonialism throughout the semester limiting. The main component of the class is writing—especially the weekly reading responses—which can be challenging and is graded strictly.

That said, it’s a valuable experience for improving your writing and learning to engage critically with texts. Just be prepared for the writing component to take center stage."

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class. Take this course esepcially if you want to read more and read these types of texts and engage with them in a relaxed and growth-centered manner but dont have the time in your personal life or other classes to do so.

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

Often in courses that do literary theory, the 'author dead' (whether or not they are actually dead) so we aren't invested in conversations around what they were reading or who they were talking to at a given moment. But since we were all deep in Sedgwick's papers, it was 'stimulating' (Sedgwick would appreciate that that is the word being used in this question) to be able to bring up in class 'oh that thought is one that came up in X email to Y person and was actually related there to this other idea that isn't in the published work explicitly, Z)."
