Please describe three specific things you learned.","Entering this study abroad program, I anticipated immersing myself in Spanish culture and cuisine. However, I soon discovered that our exploration went beyond surface-level understanding. We delved deep into the authentic essence of being Spanish, unveiling a fascinating tapestry of migration and diverse identities within Spain. Through this enlightening perspective, we engaged in thought-provoking discussions about Madrid's historical ties to slavery and the impact of the Franco regime. Moreover, I gained practical skills, such as effectively using social media platforms like Instagram to share my Spanish experiences through captivating narratives. Yet, the most impactful aspect of this course was its focus on identity and the struggles faced by immigrants from around the world as they search for their place within Spain's vibrant mosaic."

The instructors skillfully curated a curriculum that balanced theoretical knowledge with real-world examples, fostering a deeper understanding of the topics at hand. Additionally, the course incorporated interactive methods of instruction, such as group projects and multimedia (instagram and video). These approaches not only made the learning experience more dynamic but also encouraged collaboration and the application of theoretical concepts to practical situations. By actively engaging with the material, I was able to develop a deeper level of comprehension and retain the information more effectively. Additionally, the professors fostered an atmosphere that encouraged students to express their thoughts and emotions openly, even if they were uncomfortable or conflicted. Through this approach, we were able to explore contrasting viewpoints and grapple with the complexities of the subject matter, deepening our understanding and promoting personal growth.The professors skillfully navigated through difficult and potentially controversial topics, such as the historical legacy of slavery in Madrid and the complex regime of Francisco Franco."

It's an interesting mix of the study abroad experience - while there are lots of assignments for class, there is still some freedom to explore Spain on your own. Sometimes, the work was a bit overwhelming, but overall the course was manageable. The class field trips are a blast and really give you a fuller look at Spain as a country (outside of just Madrid). The professors are supportive, there are so many ways of learning that they explore (movies, music, readings, museum trips, etc.), and the whole staff is great about giving suggestions and offering help whenever you need it. It's a great timeframe to go abroad without committing to a whole semester, and it gives you a really unique experience somewhere between being a visitor and a resident of Spain."

The course is incredibly interesting, and it is an amazing introduction to Spain. The assignments allowed us to go explore the city for class, and you see Madrid through a non-tourist lens. It's definitely not a difficult course, and it's a bargain to receive two credits for 400-level Spanish, a HUGE jumpstart on the minor. I would recommend taking a 300-level before taking it. (Look into the Mac Anderson Global Eduction Scholarship!)"

It really forced me to be critical of mediums I never really analyzed before and dig beyond the facades of those mediums. The visits to other parts of Spain as well as sites in Madrid were also magical and thought-provoking.

I will say that the professors can be a bit unclear towards what they want out of assignments which can make things stressful. Similarly, besides the class, it's really up to the students to find their own ways of immersion within the class which can also be difficult since you are in a new country."

Living in Madrid is amazing, the city is so rich with culture and history.  I learned so much inside and outside of the classroom.  The class itself is very interesting, all of our discussions and guest speakers discussed relevant and stimulating topics.  My Spanish speaking and comprehension wildly improved."

Most of the time, you'll have lots of free time outside of class to explore the city and spend time with others in the program. The professors are really nice, but sometimes fussy about participation/nit-picky things. They're also really fun to be with during the excursions. Definitely get to know them, and try to participate in class. Also, there's ~2 free weekends, and you should definitely consider traveling Europe outside of class."

You're in Madrid and get to explore the city and much more while learning history in Spanish. Try to speak as much Spanish as you can. Don't stop speaking it even if other people speak to you in English.Be aware that the professor has favorites."

It's an interesting mix of the study abroad experience - while there are lots of assignments for class, there is still some freedom to explore Spain on your own. Sometimes, the work was a bit overwhelming, but overall the course was manageable. The class field trips are a blast and really give you a fuller look at Spain as a country (outside of just Madrid). The professors are supportive, there are so many ways of learning that they explore (movies, music, readings, museum trips, etc.), and the whole staff is great about giving suggestions and offering help whenever you need it. It's a great timeframe to go abroad without committing to a whole semester, and it gives you a really unique experience somewhere between being a visitor and a resident of Spain."

The course is incredibly interesting, and it is an amazing introduction to Spain. The assignments allowed us to go explore the city for class, and you see Madrid through a non-tourist lens. It's definitely not a difficult course, and it's a bargain to receive two credits for 400-level Spanish, a HUGE jumpstart on the minor. I would recommend taking a 300-level before taking it. (Look into the Mac Anderson Global Eduction Scholarship!)"
