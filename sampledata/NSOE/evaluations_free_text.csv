Having mini field books in which there is pictures and descriptors can help intellectually stimulate us more while going on field trips to help us identify organisms.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","My way of thinking fundamentally shifted after taking this class. The biggest way this occurred was from thinking in ways from a normative sense to a critical sense. I had previously not thought of much of the forces behind the environmental interventions that are made. Now I am much more interested in how an environmental intervention, especially the important/trendy topic, come to be. This entails thinking about who is part of the movement, what alternative explanations/solutions are left out, and what could be some unintended consequences of the intervention. From this course I learned that ITQs have a social cost not internalized by their creation, that green militarization can be linked to the othering of local people. and that globalization has fundamentally presented new challenges to peasant studies."

Although we joked we weren't good at time management the conversations that really got flowing were really interesting and allowed me to learn more than just the material and learn from my classmates as well.
