Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course taught me several new topics:
1. Decision Theory and the evolution of the field.
2. Building arguments for one or the other side and acknowledging differing directions of scientific conclusions
3. Thinking deeply about arguments and leaning on deep understanding of literature to build scientific arguments"

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1) Knowledge/Way of thinking: We should think about process more when trying to help people make better decisions. Information isn't enough if people don't know how to use it to reach a goal.
2) Methods/Way of thinking: The reflection papers helped me get better at digesting and summarizing complex articles and weaving them together. I've already transferred this skill to other classes and my own research process.
3) Knowledge/Insights: We don't need to focus on individual differences as much in decision-making. They aren't always as interesting or meaningful as we'd expect them to be."

1. Focus on discussion in class and bringing in diverse perspectives. I really enjoyed the opportunity to learn from peers.
2. Thorough analysis of research articles through biweekly assignments, helped to practice article summaries and encouraged in-depth understanding of material."

Writing the reflection paper encouraged us to read more carefully and think more.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I really appreciated how clear the course structure and expectations were from the beginning. All topics and assignments were spelled out from the first week, which made it easy to plan accordingly. I was impressed by how much I got out of the variety of assignments we had -- reflection papers every other week, occasional pre-class tasks alongside the readings, a proposal for our final project, and a flash talk paper presentation. The reflection papers were really valuable for me. They actually shaped how I engage with readings for other classes now, summarizing each reading and/or connecting them in a bigger picture that I can remember. I was also impressed by how quickly the professor gave us feedback on those papers, and how thoughtful his comments were. This helped me learn as we went. The flash talks were a great way to bring in people's background interests and connect to what we were doing that week. I would keep the structure and format the same. The topics all flowed into each other nicely and built on each other. By the last few weeks I felt prepared to take on the more applied/real world themes and readings, with the foundation from earlier weeks."

The professor did a great job of remembering all of our areas of interest (from our intros and from our reflection papers) and flagging them during class so that people had a chance to share. He also had a very thoughtful and gentle way of pulling us into the conversation when we weren't speaking up. It always felt like a safe place to try out a weird thought or idea. That made the class more intellectually stimulating, because we could be creative in our thinking out loud. I also felt that the reflection papers we did every other week helped bring new ideas to the class, because they forced us to digest and absorb the info and connect it to our own areas ahead of time instead of on the spot."

It is about the fundamental ways in which we think about ourselves and the world around us.

I've already told everyone I know to take it. The professor is wonderful -- an expert in the field, deeply engaged with the class, thoughtful with feedback, and just kind. The class met at 9am on Fridays and I was always excited to go, which says something! This is the kind of class and class environment I was hoping to have during my time at Duke, and I couldn't recommend it more -- for all kinds of disciplinary backgrounds."
