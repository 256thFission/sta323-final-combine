Please describe three specific things you learned.","One of the most transformative concepts I learned was systems thinking, particularly the use of the Iceberg Model. This framework taught me to analyze problems at multiple levels—moving from surface-level events to identifying underlying patterns, structures, and mental models that drive behavior. For example, instead of focusing solely on team conflicts as isolated incidents, I now consider how organizational structures or unspoken norms might contribute to recurring issues. This deeper way of thinking has helped me approach challenges with a more strategic mindset.
This course emphasized that effective leadership begins with self-awareness. Through reflection exercises and discussions, I learned to assess my strengths, values, and blind spots. For instance, I realized that while I’m strong at goal-setting, I need to improve my listening skills to foster better collaboration. Recognizing these traits has helped me align my leadership style with my values and the needs of those I work with, making me a more empathetic and intentional leader."

One of the most valuable things that I really learned was the emphasis on leadership not just being about how the leader's personal style of leadership may not be the most effective for the entire team, so it is more beneficial to have some emphasis on building a culture and environment that emphasizes both. I learned that quite often the leader can forget about connecting with the worker, and part of the struggle can be the leader expecting their personal level of output, rather than the worker's best, this can lead to a disconnect and a clash if not taken care of. Something that I found very interesting was the way a person can choose culture or job fit to the person. Not something I had previously thought about at all."

There are two required presentations for this course. One of them is a group project in which you complete assigned readings and then prepare a presentation to teach the class. This was a great way to make sure that we understood what we were learning. The second presentation was a project with the same group in which you apply all the topics we learned to analyze a company that we chose at the beginning of the semester. Both of these projects were a great way to learn how to work on a team. We had to learn how to coordinate our schedules, delegate roles, create presentations, synthesize information, and so much more. We also had four major written assignments throughout the semester and a weekly written assignment. The four major assignments were very interesting and fun to complete because of how creative they were. They helped me understand the topics we were learning on a deeper level and were a great way to practice concise writing. Each Sunday we had to submit a question about anything covered in class throughout the week and we had to respond to two students' questions. An AI model graded our responses. This was also a great activity because it caused us to reflect on the course on a weekly basis and try to think of open-ended questions. It was a great and easy way to stimulate conversation!"

One of the most applicable, useful classes I've taken at Duke so far. Felt like there was purpose behind what I was doing and I could assess my intellectual progress and understanding in real-time through the results of the simulation, which measured things concretely.
The final product was a great culmination of everything we learned and creative and rounded out the class and the way we all bonded."

We not only discussed key strategies and helpful phrases, goals, and questions that can facilitate the interview process, but also had continuous check-ins with both the class as a whole as well as our smaller groups, which provided moral support and community guidance. This class also delved into personal finance, which I can always learn more in and was HUGELY appreciated and helpful. I've also never made a career plan or financial plan before, often flying by the seat of my pants as I progress through life. The intentionality and careful thought required for these assignments and practices was really grounding and helpful, and eased worries about the future."

I also was not sure what we would be doing in class week to week, it was almost like a surprise and you were always encouraged to present your findings from the out of class work. I really enjoyed being in Professor Veraldi's presence and class because he wanted us to succeed and taught with passion. He really cared about all of us and had a lot to offer."

Instead we just did a ton of work with little feedback and did not dig deeper.

Also, the broader topic of urban planning / smart cities really did not align with the rest of the MMS certificate studies and should not be the topic of the capstone. Focusing on organizations/business, as was marketed for this class, would maybe be better (or just informing students of the 2 sections beforehand)."

Every city assignment was analyzing municipal finance and it was extremely repetitive and hard to understand. Almost every paper we did was just summarizing something, there was no creativity or reflection. I get absolutely nothing from writing a summary. Also, we never learned anything in class- he just had us present extremely long and boring summary presentation the whole time. He's a nice person, but not a good teacher: he never used any visuals or powerpoints, he would talk at us and go on random tangents for 45 minutes, and didn't give us any breaks even though it was a 2.5 hour night class. It was so so difficult to pay attention."
MMS-450-01_Veraldi__Samuel_Fall_2024.html,Fall 2024,MMS-450-01 : MARKETS/MGMNT CAPSTONE.MMS-450-01.,Samuel Veraldi,4,What made this class stimulating or how could it be more intellectually stimulating if it wasn’t?,"The class was stimulating because of the readings we did outside of class. I found that getting to pick our own book for our group book critique was nice because it allowed us to find something that we were really interested in. I personally felt that I learned a lot from the book that we chose and appreciate the flexibility. However, the class sessions themselves were often just a summary of the readings, sometimes requiring us to simply regurgitate what we read via a presentation and then present it to the class without any analysis or time to talk. It might have been more intellectually stimulating if there were more lectures with specific detail that were balanced with more guided discussions in smaller groups. There didn't seem to be a lot of case studies that we went over that weren't touched on in the readings. A wider spread of activities could have also been interesting, like a guest lecture or a different project instead of 4 papers."

Lots of outside work, but very little in class work / time since only once a week. Three books + critiques, a few readings, four 4-page assignments, and a final team project + paper -- it was a lot.

I'm not sure why an urban planning class is the capstone. If you have to take it you can tough it out. But it is extremely boring.

The workload in it of itself is fine, however, the way that the class is taught can be incredibly frustrating. While the topic itself is very interesting, the group that you get has a big impact on your experience. While the professor is nice, he does not always seem responsive to students that ask for feedback and it is difficult to tell if he is actually reading all of the work we do, which is frustrating because there is a lot of it."

The smart technology is interesting, and its applications are cool so that element of the class was thought-provoking and enjoyable to learn/present on."
