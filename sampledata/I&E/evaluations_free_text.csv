Another valuable skill I learned from this course is conducting stakeholder interviews. I learned about what e-methane was - I had no idea what e-methane was or what the market for it was prior to taking this course. I also learned how to conduct a SWOT market analysis which I had not learned before.

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter.

The real-world feel of the class was something I had been craving out of school my whole life. You can't look up the answers to this class on Chegg! You have to look in the real world! This was incredibly an incredibly stimulating aspect.How could it be more intellectually stimulating:
More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments. If we had, there would have been more opportunity for intellectual stimulation."

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments.

They were more dynamic and allowed us to incorporate a lot of skills we personally had. It gave us an organization or community to reach out to, which helped. I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy."" I think the final paper was kind of shoved in there at the end, but I much prefer that over any final exam."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","One of the biggest takeaways from this class is how I learned that in social innovation, you have to stay true to your values to create impact and change. Social innovation is not a well-trodden path, and yet needs to be propose a implement an innovation that is better than any existing ones: and with that, doubts and taking risks may seem daunting. But knowing what you're passionate about and ""falling in love"" with the problem at hand, can facilitate thinking into action, whether that be in problem analysis, team building, impact gap analysis, etc. Additionally, I learned that Social Innovation (in deriving traits from Human centered Design) puts people at the center of the problem, and hence, with that in mind, it means that a social innovator needs to cater towards the users' habits. And furthermore, when these two aspects of passion and putting people at the center merge, considerations for theory of change, iterating of your solution, and communicating to investors and other people to create a 'team' can follow; however, I also learned that money is a significant factor into creating an sustainable organization that can create impact long-term --> impact investing!"

There is a lot of teamwork and task delegation involved. Dr. Clements is very quick to help, and his constructive criticisms are always very meaningful. He really desires to see his students succeed, which is evident in the way he interacts with them. The personal life plan paper is a great way Dr. Clements gets students thinking about their future goals and career paths, which are intentionally based on our past experiences."

I think a lot of times global health is presented as a set of statistics which are definitely important to know and understand, but it is equally as important to be able to find solutions to these problems. As such, I enjoyed that the project was to design a solution to an actual global health problem. It felt applicable and real. That being said, there were a couple class periods that felt a bit slow.

- You will most likely get restless since most of the 2.5-hour lectures are non-interactive.
- There is no outside help in this course since the challenge is to deduce everything we don't know. If you have a doubt and email the TAs, they will say ""We expect you to attempt this by yourself and provide 0 help"". The TAs are also more just graders that I'm not sure have the expertise to be assessing us on a relative scale. It feels like they are hearing about the case studies with us. Not good.
- FUQUA IS FAR. You need to be here at 1:40 or whatever the starting time is otherwise it'll affect your grade. Doesn't make sense. Being 15 seconds late can't take off a percent of your grade.
- There are readings (need to pay $120) but she does not ask us directly to talk about it."

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments.

More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter.

The real-world feel of the class was something I had been craving out of school my whole life. You can't look up the answers to this class on Chegg! You have to look in the real world! This was incredibly an incredibly stimulating aspect.How could it be more intellectually stimulating:
More team building / alignment exercises / time-spent agreeing on what the project will look like. To be fair, this may be the fault of our Team Charter. However, I believe that that assignment could have been so much more than filling out the Team Charter template that the professors provided. We didn't realy talk about a way to come up with ideas and build them out. We didn't talk about how we were going to implement science and engineering into the course's assignments. If we had, there would have been more opportunity for intellectual stimulation."

It was unstructured, the assignments felt random, there was no classroom engagement, there was no attempt to make sure everyone had a baseline knowledge of what was talked about, it was guest speakers speaking about their life and questions being asked by the same seven people because no one else knew what was going on. Oh and the students were not able to reach out to the professor. I directly emailed him multiple times and never got a response back. Students are forced to communicate directly with the TAs and have them be messengers to the professor. If I could I would restructure the course from the group up or not even teach it if the the changes are not made."

I think that some more activities around applying these concepts, or more detailed lessons could have been helpful. Alternatively, perhaps a short reading could be provided prior to lessons so that the class could all get to at least a baseline understanding prior to the class discussions. This could be more helpful for people who were less familiar, and could then allow for a richer discussion for people who were already familiar and wanted to try to take their learning and application to the next level.As noted above, I also think it would have been more interesting and helpful to meet the founders at the beginning of the course as well, and give us more context and more to think about/ consider throughout the term, reducing the time of the learning curve, and allowing for more time for critical thinking and analysis."

- I learned about starting with you ""why"" and talking about what you believe, not what you do.
- I learned that great stories happen to those who can tell them - and I have seen this throughout my life now that I have written it down in words, it is so true. There have been times where people in my life tell great stories (about things that I was present for) and they make the story sound way better than it actually was in person!"

Advanced Storytelling Techniques – Introducing more nuanced elements of storytelling, such as psychological triggers, behavioral science principles, or cross-cultural narrative strategies, could deepen understanding and push students to think more strategically.3.

Creative placemaking, the interplay of public/private/non-profit institutions, and this is the biggest thing: a greater appreciation of arts institutions & events around me. Before this class, I really didn't look to go to museums or art exhibits or dance performances. However, my positive experiences with these aforementioned things have motivated me to go to more events around campus and Durham. I think this is most notable with the performances in Page Auditorium. I will also say this course has helped me network/ reach out when working with my community partner. This was especially relevant when I wanted to include an extra component in the project and I had to gather the resources/data from different teams in the organization and outside."

Even if you have just a little bit interest in arts, this course will be very fulfilling to take!"
