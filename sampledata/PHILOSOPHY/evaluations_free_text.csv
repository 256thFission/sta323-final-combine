We sat in a loose circle, facing each other, and spoke candidly about our thoughts when we did the reading. He also did a great job breaking very complicated philosophies into simple arguments so that we could better understand what was being discussed."

My favorite readings that I can remember at the moment were ""On Bullshit,"" ""Lovers in the Hands of a Patient God,"" and ""The Right to Sex."" Since this is a class for first year students and is probably a first philosophy class for many (including myself), mixing in the more scholarly works like Kant and Mill with less dense, more informal works is helpful. I liked the discussion based format and how the instructor asked thoughtful, intentional questions to promote deeper understandings."

Sometimes I think concepts needed to be a bit more grounded. I would appreciate a reading guide and a note-taking guide because I'm afraid I didn't grasp the concepts as well as I could have. I would like to conclude the class with the skill to articulate the main points of major philosopical works like Kant and Mill but I don't feel confident in my ability to do that (although, I have become quite fascinated by the concept of agency. It is definitely informing how I view the world, which I am very appreciative of)."

Professor Summers knows that that reading was difficult and he will go over all the main ideas from the text in class to make the reading much clearer.

I recommend reading through on your own and making annotations, then using chatGPT to summarize for added clarity. Make sure to draw your own assumptions first and do your own reading so you can actually develop your mind! Also, drink a coffee before class. You need to be fully focused; the concepts get quite deep...fast."
