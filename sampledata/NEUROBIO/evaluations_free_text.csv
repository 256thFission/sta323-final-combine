Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","While I learned a lot throughout this semester and performed well, this was not to the credit of the instruction method or the overall structure of the course. It has been stated that the intent of this course is to level the playing field, considering that individuals will be entering the program with varying backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience. However, the course was structured like a seminar with discussion of topical journal articles for each class and no direct instruction of material in the text was provided. I believe this format was somewhat intellectually stimulating and would have been reasonable if students were not tested on material from the text. However, since exams were based solely on the textbook, this required students to teach themselves the material. This, therefore, makes me question whether the purpose of the course of ""leveling the playing field and creating a strong foundation in cog neuro"" was indeed realized. Still, I would like to add that Dr. Cabeza was very accessible, graded fairly, and created a positive classroom environment."
