Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",My learning was facilitated by the video forum and 1 weekly assignment as it allowed me to complete homework on my own time and on topics we had already discussed in class as opposed to having a flipped classroom. I think I would keep the in class discussion and group work as it helped me learn from my peers and encouraged me to speak up.

This course will not cause you unnecessary stress or grievance. As long as you are prepared (and the homework doesn't ask much of you) and willing to engage with the material in class, you will learn a lot, even if you already have a good grasp of natural selection or evolutionary biology. My main takeaway was that there are so many clever ways in which different animals solve a common set of evolutionary ""problems"" and sometimes they aren't what you'd expect. I also realized pretty quickly that I need to stop thinking so anthropologically about animals whose umvelts are clearly unlike ours."

Also, it would have felt more intuitive for the writing prompts to be about the readings for Monday rather than Wednesday. Having a prompt due made me want to prioritize the Wednesday readings, but of course the Monday ones are more relevant to the Monday classes."

When you make comments on the group presentations, focus more on making one or two streamlined questions or comments, as I, at first, got a bit overwhelmed on what to focus on when posing a question to a team."

I really appreciate that he shares his lecture slides and recordings, which not only support review after class but also allow students to revisit material they may have missed. Many of my teachers avoid sharing these resources, likely as a way to encourage attendance, but Dr. Sommer's lectures are so engaging and informative that students want to go to class, and being able to review content afterward only enhances the learning experience and helps me achieve a deeper understanding. I also enjoy that he incorporates a variety of learning modalities—coding, reading primary literature, exploring both historical context and detailed anatomical content—which keeps the material dynamic and intellectually stimulating. Although the use of pop quizzes would typically not seem favorable, I found the way he implements them very positive and successful in encouraging me to consistently review notes, while his flexibility in offering partial and extra credit shows his genuine commitment to student success and learning.

2. Understanding of neuroscience -- I'm not a neuroscience major and so I had no prior knowledge on how the brain worked at all. Getting to hold a human brain in my own hands was really special and I thought that the level of information that we could get was varied enough that a neuroscience major would learn something and a newbie like me could as well.

I truly enjoyed learning about the intersections between science and religion, in a way that held space for all opinions, faiths, and backgrounds. I didn't feel like one faith or perspective was pressed onto us, and I learned how to dive into my thoughts and mind and truly decide where I stood on issues. I learned how complex conversations surrounding evolution truly are through the different evolutionary theories-- I did not realize how much of evolutionary theory was not agreed upon, because in high school it seemed like Darwinian- natural selection was the main and agreed upon definition of evolution. Also, I have never taken a philosophy class before, and I am so glad I took this one, because I learned about various ancient philosophers, how to contrast their ideas, and specifically learned about their ideas of the mind and God, which I find fascinating as a Neuroscience student. Finally, we went to Prof. Len White's brain lab, and I had so much fun going in the context of this course. Looking at the biological brain, but harboring these deep questions about religion and what it means to be human in the back of my mind from our readings, was truly remarkable."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","QUESTION ONE:
1. Engaging Lectures: Both the instructor's dynamic lectures and his incorporation of incredible guest lectures combined clear explanations of scientific concepts with thought-provoking questions that encouraged deeper exploration, in a non-conventional lecture format.
Discussion-Based Learning: The emphasis on open discussion allowed students to express diverse viewpoints and refine their arguments collaboratively. After each comment, the instructor maintained the ideal balance between validating his students' beliefs, further fostering an environment in which communication is valid, and also challenging them, asking follow-up questions intended with gauging their depth of analysis.
QUESTION TWO (Components to Retain):
1. Interdisciplinary Readings: Including a blend of neuroscience papers, religious texts, and philosophical essays was invaluable for a holistic learning experience. I will most definitely be re-reading my favorites of the one's he provided, like Lucretius and Plantinga. Not a single reading was short of exceedingly awe-provoking.
Interactive Class Discussions: These fostered a sense of intellectual curiosity among students, compelling me to take the class' complex commentary on the workings of the world with me everywhere I go as I continue to grapple with pressing inquiries, like the pursuit for meaning and the epistemological explanation for existence."

It made me realize how empiricism is another school of thought, and our current world might be biased towards it. But there is something undeniably visceral about the human experience, that cannot be explained by science, at least not right now, and so there must be room for some higher power... this is a kind of conversation we would have in class!

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","This instructor structured this course into a group-based learning environment; however, I believe that the majority of this class is centered around quizzes and exams. Both of which are poorly constructed and do not accurately reflect students' learning. I believe that there needs to be some serious reconstruction in the way quizzes and exams are created to both accurately reflect the information discussed in class and as well as from the textbook. Time after time, questions that were posed to questions had to be remediated, reworded, or just removed because they were worded incredibly poorly or had nothing to do with the content that was being discussed. The idea of group-based learning should alleviate the pressure off of the instructor teaching the course; however, it still seemed as though this professor was constantly stressing over mistakes that she made that could have easily been avoided. I believe that while this method of instruction should be helpful to both students and professors, in this class it should be reworked to actually benefit both instructor and student."

I would caution that certain units tend to be harder than others, so one shouldn't expect each week to have the same amount of pre-class content in store. This comes to a fore in the midterm, which can be deceptively difficult given that the questions seem to be more difficult than on the RATs—or maybe the cumulative nature plays a sneaky role."

Keeping up with what needs to be done isn't overly difficult and the content is quite interesting. One thing to consider is that the exams may not meet your expectations. That is, the exam isn't that similar to the short in-class assessments. I would say focus more on the relevance and impacts rather than isolated information. However, there is some isolated information that you may need to know, and it may be difficult to know what information will appear. As Dr. Ng suggests, when preparing for example, focus on the learning objectives."

I would even take if you are considering neuroscience but not sure. There is a lot of content, but if you put in the work, it's manageable.

A lot of the times the quizzes will ask a random obscure question that is just memorization and is not an application of knowledge. Be prepared to rely on other people. As it is a team based activity you have to do things as a team, its annoying if you like doing work on your own and do not like relying on other people. Things will take a long time, and the mid-term is just ridiculous as it covered very obscure content that most would expect would not be needed to know.

It takes persevering as it can be quite frustrating when the midterm has several errors (typos, incorrect questions) and when it asks about niche details from a single slide of a lecture or a single diagram from the textbook rather than asking about overarching ideas or checking for overall understanding of main concepts. Some of the RAT quizzes at the beginning of the semester are also like this. The professor can be a bit passive-aggressive sometimes and even got mad at students for doing poorly on the exam (arguing that students clearly ""didn't study/prioritize the class"" although all students I knew including myself prepared rigorously for the exam)."

I feel that it is a great gateway course into the field, and offers a diverse range of topics students can explore to see what truly interests them. For instance, a student may find that they are interested in the more physical aspects of neuroscience, such as the intersection between vision and neuroscience. Other students may find a passion for using neuroscience to answer more philosophical questions, such as how our consciousness and perception of the world influences what we observe and take note of in day to day interactions."

1. Read textbook chapter night before
2. Take quiz based mostly on memorization
3. Forget what you read
4. Repeat
Throughout the semester there aren't any checkpoints or projects that tie back the information we've been learning. I often feel that once the iRAT is over, there's no reinforcement of what was learned and there's no reason to continue to know what we learned the week before. This class could benefit from more in-class activities that reinforce previous material and require us to recall what we learned before so that it doesn't get forgotten and lost immediately.The iRATs themselves are also not very stimulating because they are mostly based on memorization and don't usually require a great understanding of the material. I think is partly due to the fact that our only knowledge of the subject comes from reading a textbook. A better structure might be to have us read before Tuesday, then do APP's or Labs then conclude the week with iRATs to ensure that we comprehended what we did that week."

I feel like when you are used to working alone, it is easy to think in a certain way; however, when you work with a team, you have to think differently and sometimes with more logic and evidence to back up your thoughts in case there are disagreements within your group.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone curious about neuroscience, as it provides a solid introduction without being overly stressful. However, it's important to note that this class has a strong self-directed learning component. If you're someone who thrives in a structured, guided environment, this may not be the best fit. But if you're comfortable teaching yourself and staying on top of the material independently, this course can be a rewarding and insightful experience."

We focused on a different topic in the textbook every week so some weeks are harder or easier than others (for ex, the week on vision was hard but the week on stress was a lot more chill). Weekly work requires reading the textbook module and preparing for the iRAT each Tuesday. You don't have to really study for the iRAT if you take good notes while reading the textbook/watching the assigned video. Quizzes are easy to do well on (simple MCQ) and they curve them - you can get up to 3 questions wrong and still get a grade of 15/15. Overall, the class is not bad and it's not difficult to do well as long as you do your work."

The only part that was less stimulating was reading the articles for Thursdays' lectures occasionally.

The in-class application activities were occasionally intellectually stimulating, but since the questions and answers marked as ""correct"" often had errors, it took away from my ability to fully and accurately learn (and be stimulated by) the material. Same with the in-class lectures--I could not be intellectually stimulated since the instructor's presentations were often disorganized and displayed a not-completely-accurate understanding of course content."

We glossed over topics often, and I never really felt like we got a good dive into the content. The course is flipped, so you watch lecture and read the textbook outside of class and do weekly quizzes and application activities. I would say that with this structure, the same level of work was put into the course in comparison to regular structures of classes."

Another thing I learned   are the several methods, invasive and non-invasive, for studying brain-behavior relationships, which were really fascinating because it provides definitive evidence of how our brain impacts what we do.

2. I developed knowledge on the brain anatomy and each parts functions, that as a neuroscience major, it is the gateway for all the following neuroscience courses I will take.
3. During this course, I was able to work on my way of thinking and analyzing through a research paper. Professor Mg exposed us to different research papers we later got testes on, but beforehand, explained the importance of taking your time to understand a research paper and all its details."

I think maybe the weekly quizzes are ok, but they should be on Thursdays instead of Tuesdays where Tuesdays are used to lecture about the material coming up on the quiz and to review questions from the previous unit."

It is very interesting because almost every week, we have a quiz that is taken in 2 forms. The iRAT (individual quiz) is one you take by yourself and is graded so that if you get more than 80% you will get a 100%. Then, the tRAT (team quiz) same quiz just doing it with your team while discussing potential answers and answering together. This one is fully graded on accuracy.

I think the weekly combination of iRAT, tRAT, and application activity is a strong facilitator of learning. I liked the incorporation of real research to complement what we were learning and to strengthen scientific literacy and critical thinking. Additionally, because we focused on one unit of knowledge per week, I was able to understand the concepts more thoroughly. Clear learning objectives were provided with each unit, which also helped guide my comprehension of big-picture concepts and make connections. I also appreciate how well-maintained the grade book was. I would keep all of these aspects of the course in future years."

That was really hands-on and engaging. More labs or interactive activities could be nice, and I know it was mentioned that they are working on more neuroscience labs. More vocal variety and energy in lectures could be helpful, but Dr. Newpher is a great professor and explains things well. I am glad the lecture videos are made available because sometimes lectures are a bit fast to take notes on everything, but I like that it is fast because otherwise I would become distracted I think.

Sometimes the textbook goes into details that we don't cover in class so prioritizing the powerpoints/lectures and using the textbook as supplement is probably the best approach. The quiz questions can be pretty detailed (ex: asking about specific proteins or steps in pathways), so there is a lot of memorization involved. However, Newpher has a very distinct (and straight forward) style of asking questions, so once you start to notice patterns it makes things a bit easier."

It's the right amount of content in the right amount of time.
--Dr. Newpher has an amazing teaching style-- things make sense the way he explains them. The way his slides are organized are through pictures and diagrams– this helps paint a clear picture & emphasizes understanding of pathways
--recorded videos were super helpful along with learning objectives
--canvas page was organized very nicely
--Liked the team-based learning– how it held each group member accountable but incorporated teamwork each week
--I found the review sessions before exams very helpful 
--I liked how Dr. Newpher walked us through the research papers with mini-lessons or background before our assignments because it made reading the research papers MUCH less daunting
--Dr. Newpher's office hours are very helpful!"

I would say that Neuro223 has been the most worthwhile class I've taken at Duke and definitely my favorite. As a neuroscience major, taking Neuro223 felt like I finally was learning what I came to Duke to learn. Dr. Newpher is an amazing professor, and I would highly, highly suggest taking Neuro223 with him. His enthusiasm for both teaching and neuroscience shows through his compassionate help. 
I would say this course is slightly difficult (definitely more difficult than Neuro102). Most topics are not challenging to understand, but the extent to which we are expected to understand some concepts is quite detailed. Thus, I would highly suggest having a working understanding of biology, chemistry, and physics before taking this class, since these concepts are fundamental to the class, such as understanding how ions establish the electrochemical gradient and how current and voltage are related. Additionally, I would say that it's not necessary to read the textbook for this class, as Newpher tests only based off his slideshows, and the textbook includes many unnecessary details."

I'm a computer science major and never really got exposure to natural sciences as a whole and this class was a perfect way to be able to get that exposure. It was amazing to be able to touch on so many things such as physics, biology, computer science even from a perspective of philosophical inquiry and relating it to religion.

I was really forced to understand the concepts underlying some of the most important questions that we as humans face, such as the reliability of our cognitive faculties. The essay prompts broke down these concepts and I'm definitely going to be breaking down complicated concepts in a similar way that the professor did for future difficult essays. 
2. Understanding of neuroscience -- I'm not a neuroscience major and so I had no prior knowledge on how the brain worked at all. Getting to hold a human brain in my own hands was really special and I thought that the level of information that we could get was varied enough that a neuroscience major would learn something and a newbie like me could as well. 
3. One of my biggest insights into the class was being truly captivated by my fellow Duke peers' intellect. Many of us came from different majors and backgrounds and every person added such an interest take to the conversations. I was truly impressed with the depth of knowledge and philosophical thinking of my peers."

I truly enjoyed learning about the intersections between science and religion, in a way that held space for all opinions, faiths, and backgrounds. I didn't feel like one faith or perspective was pressed onto us, and I learned how to dive into my thoughts and mind and truly decide where I stood on issues. I learned how complex conversations surrounding evolution truly are through the different evolutionary theories-- I did not realize how much of evolutionary theory was not agreed upon, because in high school it seemed like Darwinian- natural selection was the main and agreed upon definition of evolution. Also, I have never taken a philosophy class before, and I am so glad I took this one, because I learned about various ancient philosophers, how to contrast their ideas, and specifically learned about their ideas of the mind and God, which I find fascinating as a Neuroscience student. Finally, we went to Prof. Len White's brain lab, and I had so much fun going in the context of this course. Looking at the biological brain, but harboring these deep questions about religion and what it means to be human in the back of my mind from our readings, was truly remarkable."

I feel I was better able to listen to my peers' ideas and respond to their questions. I learned a lot of names of my classmates, which I don't feel is normally the case, and it was fun. Also, Prof. Watkins always held office hours, and doing so showed be that he was very determined to provide us students support, even if that meant taking away his personal work time. I could tell that when a guest speaker came (this is a part of the class I enjoyed-- the diverse and high number of intelligent and renowned guest speakers), Prof. Watkins was genuinely excited for US to get to interact with them."

I liked his structure with a reading assignment (and sometimes a very short reading response) and then a class discussion on the reading. But these were very low-stakes and unstressful conversations where he had a set of discussion questions and prompts ready to promote conversation and debate. Professor Watkins did a wonderful job keeping the class engaged and interested in the material with several guest lecturers and class visits. We even got to go to Dr. White's brain lab in DIBS!

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","QUESTION ONE:
1. Engaging Lectures: Both the instructor's dynamic lectures and his incorporation of incredible guest lectures combined clear explanations of scientific concepts with thought-provoking questions that encouraged deeper exploration, in a non-conventional lecture format.
Discussion-Based Learning: The emphasis on open discussion allowed students to express diverse viewpoints and refine their arguments collaboratively. After each comment, the instructor maintained the ideal balance between validating his students' beliefs, further fostering an environment in which communication is valid, and also challenging them, asking follow-up questions intended with gauging their depth of analysis.
QUESTION TWO (Components to Retain):
1. Interdisciplinary Readings: Including a blend of neuroscience papers, religious texts, and philosophical essays was invaluable for a holistic learning experience. I will most definitely be re-reading my favorites of the one's he provided, like Lucretius and Plantinga. Not a single reading was short of exceedingly awe-provoking.
Interactive Class Discussions: These fostered a sense of intellectual curiosity among students, compelling me to take the class' complex commentary on the workings of the world with me everywhere I go as I continue to grapple with pressing inquiries, like the pursuit for meaning and the epistemological explanation for existence."

It made me realize how empiricism is another school of thought, and our current world might be biased towards it. But there is something undeniably visceral about the human experience, that cannot be explained by science, at least not right now, and so there must be room for some higher power... this is a kind of conversation we would have in class!

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course provided me with a deeper and more holistic understanding of the complexities involved in drug development and treatment. Professor Sawyer did an exceptional job of teaching us not just the biological mechanisms of how drugs work, but also the various biological, physiological, ethical, and societal factors that must be considered when developing and administering treatments. Her approach emphasized that the development of drugs is not just about scientific discovery but also about understanding their real-world impact, including considerations of access, safety, and patient care. This broader perspective helped me appreciate the intricate balance between efficacy and the diverse ethical and practical issues involved in drug therapies.
One of the most valuable skills I developed was the ability to research and write a comprehensive report on a drug's effectiveness, particularly in relation to a specific medical issue, such as vasculitis. I had the opportunity to explore why current treatments were ineffective and collaborate with my peers to propose novel drug solutions. This hands-on project pushed me to think critically about treatment limitations and how to improve them. The experience of designing a clinical trial for the drug was particularly enlightening. It gave me valuable insight into the complex processes of trial design, including identifying variables, ensuring patient safety, and navigating ethical concerns. This knowledge is something I would not have gained without the course and will be essential in my future as a physician.
Perhaps the most profound insight I gained was understanding how drugs affect biological processes and why certain drugs work for some patients but not for others. This realization highlighted the importance of personalized medicine, where treatment plans are tailored to the unique genetic, environmental, and physiological factors of each patient. I now appreciate that drug development and administration are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, they require a humanistic and comprehensive approach that takes into account the full complexity of the patient. This way of thinking—focused on patient individuality and the variability of biological responses—will inform my approach to patient care, ensuring I treat people as whole individuals rather than as cases or conditions to be managed."

I liked how I was able to use my imagination, curiosity, and knowledge from previous classes to do the project. It would be really cool if I saw this drug being made in the future. I also liked the concept of the biweekly quizzes compared to larger tests, since they were more digestable. The grading and organization of the class was good in terms of number of assignments. Dr. Sawyer was also an amazing professor and was able to meet outside of class whenever I needed help with brainstorming or class content. The slides were also generally useful to review later on, and the lectures were very organized. I really liked the 3 assignments we did, especially the last one.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The structure and components of this course created an ideal learning environment that blended traditional instruction with active, collaborative learning. I particularly appreciated the balance between didactic lectures, where we were introduced to new information, and the group activities that encouraged us to engage directly with real-world problems. This dual approach allowed me to not only absorb the material but also to apply it in meaningful ways. Working on group projects, especially those addressing real-life issues, made the theoretical concepts we discussed in class feel relevant and tangible. The combination of learning new concepts and immediately using them to think critically and develop solutions was incredibly effective, solidifying my understanding in a way that simply listening to lectures could not have done.
One memorable example of this was the fun in-class activities, like the Halloween project, where we worked in teams to research a topic and present our findings to the class. This was not just an opportunity to deepen our knowledge, but also a chance to develop important skills in teamwork and public speaking. Learning to communicate complex information clearly and effectively is an essential skill in any field, and the experience of presenting to peers in a structured, supportive environment gave me a valuable opportunity to hone this skill. These interactive components, which emphasized collaboration and communication, are aspects of the course I would certainly recommend keeping in future iterations. They contributed to an engaging and dynamic classroom experience that was both intellectually stimulating and personally rewarding.
However, as effective as the course structure and activities were, it was Professor Sawyer’s teaching style and personal example that truly made the learning environment exceptional. She brought a calm, positive energy to every class, fostering an atmosphere where intellectual curiosity thrived. Her respectful and empathetic approach to teaching made me feel seen and heard, allowing me to ask questions and express doubts after class and engage deeply with the material. More than just imparting knowledge, she embodied the values of thoughtfulness, compassion, and ethical integrity. These qualities inspired me to approach learning and, ultimately, my future career with a sense of purpose and responsibility. Professor Sawyer’s influence went far beyond her role as a lecturer; she set a standard for how to teach with care, passion, and respect for students, and I believe that future students will benefit not only from the course’s content and structure but from her example as a role model."

In class activities and exercises that allowed for collaboration with other students greatly facilitated learning. Additionally, periodic quizzes helped me stay accountable and keep up with the material without being too stressful. The major group project of the course allowed me to apply all that I had learned in a product that demonstrated my understanding that I could feel proud of. Additionally, Dr. Sawyer was accessible both in and outside of class while we worked on our projects.

The content was familiar if you'd taken a neuro or bio class. Most people found this course really interesting, and Dr. Kuhn is very lax in her approach to teaching. I didn't care for the course because it was not as interesting as I'd thought, but that isn't to say that this course isn't great and informative for those passionate about this topic. The course was not difficult by any means, and I really enjoyed the variety in the assignments (paper, homework, in-class, take home exams, and group presentation). The amount of work required for this course definitely comes in waves. Sometimes there's a good amount of work when you have an exam, and other times you really have little to do for it."

You will think about things in a way you've never previously considered. Dr. Andrews is incredible and anyone would be lucky to take a class with her. She lets you actually learn interesting things in a low-stress environment. A technology-free class environment brings me back to reality and allows for little distractions and more thoughtful conversations. Thank you Dr.Andrews for everything you do for us as students and Duke as a whole.

I would keep the TBL structure, and I would keep the presentations during the APPs rather than just answering questions. I think the presentation allowed for the groups to have to work together more whereas the questions sometimes allows for people to remain quiet while the other people in the group answered them."

Memory is very tangible topic and relevant to lives of students. I also enjoyed the team work. The frequent quizzes were sometimes annoying however I think they were so important to my keeping up with course content. Also, I think it is much better that the day of the quiz rotates rather than it always being Wednesday, for example, in the other class I took with Dr. Newpher. This levels the playing field and makes things more equitable in my opinion. Last time I had two quizzes on the same day every week and weekly EMT meetings the night before so I was never performing my best. Now the days vary and I am not much more overwhelmed than other students."

It is entirely neuroscience! I am a bit confused why this could count as Psych. I understand it is about the mind but I feel it is much more bio. I might have thought twice before taking this as a last semester senior Psych major. It is like Dr. Newpher's other classes in terms of difficulty but I am a humanities word-oriented person and was hoping this would be more psych based than the other class I took with Dr. Newpher which was Bio and Neuro coded I think. This could have been avoided if I just talked to Dr. Newpher and asked but I wanted to take another course with him and was optimistic. Dr. Newpher is a great and enthusiastic professor who does a great job supporting students. He cares about teaching and wants students to really learn. The course is fair but I still think it is hard.

He plans the course so that there is one day for the lecture on the current module, the next class we take a small quiz (first on our own and then in teams), and then the next class, to wrap up the module, we do a team application activity that is relevant for the module content. This forced me to stay on top of my studies throughout the semester and engage with the content as we went rather than leave stuff until the last minute. Dr. Newpher also does a very good job of creating a welcoming learning environment where we can ask questions and have discussions on the topics at hand without fear of judgment."

I learned how honest and realistic representations of addiction help people see the struggles that come along with substance abuse and recovery.

I also learned that depictions of DID usually include violence toward others, which is also rare in individuals with the conditions.

He's very welcoming, funny, and friendly, and very knowledgeable about the topics. I can confidently say that throughout my entire education, elementary school, middle school, high school, college, Dr Hariri is my favorite professor. A lot of the movies approach some very difficult topics, and Dr Hariri guides discussion expertly, addressing the topics but maintaining a light-hearted atmosphere.The structure was perfect. It was weekly seminars discussing a set of 2-3 movies centered on a disorder or associated topic such as institutionalization or therapy.It's one thing to read about a disorder in a textbook, but movies provide a more intimate understanding of the experience. An added layer of movies is the occasional poor representation of a disorder, which creates even more discussion about the experience. In my opinion, movies are a lot more engaging than a textbook. And that engagement got me to research each topic more on my own time. Perfect setup.As a senior neuro major, I have a very strong interest in psychopathology, and that interest is really allowed to shine without the grading stress that comes from exams. I can focus on engaging with the topics that really matter to me, rather than worrying about what might show up on an exam. The structure was perfect."

I really appreciate that he shares his lecture slides and recordings, which not only support review after class but also allow students to revisit material they may have missed. Many of my teachers avoid sharing these resources, likely as a way to encourage attendance, but Dr. Sommer's lectures are so engaging and informative that students want to go to class, and being able to review content afterward only enhances the learning experience and helps me achieve a deeper understanding. I also enjoy that he incorporates a variety of learning modalities—coding, reading primary literature, exploring both historical context and detailed anatomical content—which keeps the material dynamic and intellectually stimulating. Although the use of pop quizzes would typically not seem favorable, I found the way he implements them very positive and successful in encouraging me to consistently review notes, while his flexibility in offering partial and extra credit shows his genuine commitment to student success and learning.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course provided me with a deeper and more holistic understanding of the complexities involved in drug development and treatment. Professor Sawyer did an exceptional job of teaching us not just the biological mechanisms of how drugs work, but also the various biological, physiological, ethical, and societal factors that must be considered when developing and administering treatments. Her approach emphasized that the development of drugs is not just about scientific discovery but also about understanding their real-world impact, including considerations of access, safety, and patient care. This broader perspective helped me appreciate the intricate balance between efficacy and the diverse ethical and practical issues involved in drug therapies.
One of the most valuable skills I developed was the ability to research and write a comprehensive report on a drug's effectiveness, particularly in relation to a specific medical issue, such as vasculitis. I had the opportunity to explore why current treatments were ineffective and collaborate with my peers to propose novel drug solutions. This hands-on project pushed me to think critically about treatment limitations and how to improve them. The experience of designing a clinical trial for the drug was particularly enlightening. It gave me valuable insight into the complex processes of trial design, including identifying variables, ensuring patient safety, and navigating ethical concerns. This knowledge is something I would not have gained without the course and will be essential in my future as a physician.
Perhaps the most profound insight I gained was understanding how drugs affect biological processes and why certain drugs work for some patients but not for others. This realization highlighted the importance of personalized medicine, where treatment plans are tailored to the unique genetic, environmental, and physiological factors of each patient. I now appreciate that drug development and administration are not one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, they require a humanistic and comprehensive approach that takes into account the full complexity of the patient. This way of thinking—focused on patient individuality and the variability of biological responses—will inform my approach to patient care, ensuring I treat people as whole individuals rather than as cases or conditions to be managed."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The structure and components of this course created an ideal learning environment that blended traditional instruction with active, collaborative learning. I particularly appreciated the balance between didactic lectures, where we were introduced to new information, and the group activities that encouraged us to engage directly with real-world problems. This dual approach allowed me to not only absorb the material but also to apply it in meaningful ways. Working on group projects, especially those addressing real-life issues, made the theoretical concepts we discussed in class feel relevant and tangible. The combination of learning new concepts and immediately using them to think critically and develop solutions was incredibly effective, solidifying my understanding in a way that simply listening to lectures could not have done.
One memorable example of this was the fun in-class activities, like the Halloween project, where we worked in teams to research a topic and present our findings to the class. This was not just an opportunity to deepen our knowledge, but also a chance to develop important skills in teamwork and public speaking. Learning to communicate complex information clearly and effectively is an essential skill in any field, and the experience of presenting to peers in a structured, supportive environment gave me a valuable opportunity to hone this skill. These interactive components, which emphasized collaboration and communication, are aspects of the course I would certainly recommend keeping in future iterations. They contributed to an engaging and dynamic classroom experience that was both intellectually stimulating and personally rewarding.
However, as effective as the course structure and activities were, it was Professor Sawyer’s teaching style and personal example that truly made the learning environment exceptional. She brought a calm, positive energy to every class, fostering an atmosphere where intellectual curiosity thrived. Her respectful and empathetic approach to teaching made me feel seen and heard, allowing me to ask questions and express doubts after class and engage deeply with the material. More than just imparting knowledge, she embodied the values of thoughtfulness, compassion, and ethical integrity. These qualities inspired me to approach learning and, ultimately, my future career with a sense of purpose and responsibility. Professor Sawyer’s influence went far beyond her role as a lecturer; she set a standard for how to teach with care, passion, and respect for students, and I believe that future students will benefit not only from the course’s content and structure but from her example as a role model."

It offers a unique and comprehensive perspective on pharmacology, covering not just the biological and physiological mechanisms of drugs, but also the ethical, societal, and personal considerations that are essential for anyone pursuing a career in healthcare. As future prescribers of medication, understanding how drugs work in the body, the limitations of current treatments, and the complexities of individualized care is vital. This course goes beyond textbook knowledge—it encourages you to think critically about real-world issues, such as why certain treatments may not work for all patients and how to design drugs and clinical trials that can address these disparities. The hands-on activities, particularly the group projects, provide an excellent opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting, sharpening both your problem-solving and communication skills—critical tools for any healthcare professional. If you’re serious about becoming a thoughtful and well-rounded healthcare professional, this class is an invaluable experience."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Dr Hariri is the perfect professor for this class. He's very welcoming, funny, and friendly, and very knowledgeable about the topics. I can confidently say that throughout my entire education, elementary school, middle school, high school, college, Dr Hariri is my favorite professor. A lot of the movies approach some very difficult topics, and Dr Hariri guides discussion expertly, addressing the topics but maintaining a light-hearted atmosphere.The structure was perfect. It was weekly seminars discussing a set of 2-3 movies centered on a disorder or associated topic such as institutionalization or therapy.It's one thing to read about a disorder in a textbook, but movies provide a more intimate understanding of the experience. An added layer of movies is the occasional poor representation of a disorder, which creates even more discussion about the experience. In my opinion, movies are a lot more engaging than a textbook. And that engagement got me to research each topic more on my own time. Perfect setup.As a senior neuro major, I have a very strong interest in psychopathology, and that interest is really allowed to shine without the grading stress that comes from exams. I can focus on engaging with the topics that really matter to me, rather than worrying about what might show up on an exam. The structure was perfect."

There was no strict structure for what we had to discuss in class or write in our film reviews. I think this helped encourage me and my classmates to share creative ideas about the films, and I found a lot of what my classmates had to say about the films very intriguing!"
