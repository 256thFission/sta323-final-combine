My favorite, and in my opinion, most important area of knowledge that I received was regarding the history of Australia, its colonization, and the existence and cultural contexts of the aboriginal peoples that were first here. To fully understand and appreciate an area, a foundation of historical analysis must be first established. I strongly enjoyed learning about many of the holistic purposes of the land, how it was affected after/during colonization, and why Australia is the way it now is. It encouraged me to consider the causes and effects of human impact. 
2. I appreciated the hands-on teaching of this course. Specifically, days in which we were able to observe marine life (such as the Bondi Beach walk, Great Barrier Reef snorkel, etc.). It allowed me to fully get a grasp on my environment 
3. I have never used a field notebook in the way I have before this class. I believe that the use of a notebook and having to actively write in it while doing activities forced me to be much more attentive and engaged. I'm also thankful I have it for future reference, as it quite literally is an accumulation of everything I did/saw/learned."

Secondly, I learned about basic classification for animals and plants, including Phylums and Subphylums, as well as plant reproductive strategies. Lastly, I learned how to travel and take care of myself in a foreign country by using public transport, shopping for groceries, and finding my way around unfamiliar cities.

The majority of them have been assigned to finding restaurants and making meals. Throughout the program, my confidence grew and developed, and the meals were difficult to adventure through the cities alone and manage my time effectively. Another skill that I developed was studying with limited wifi. Some of the locations had minimal wifi, so it was important to be able to study effectively using my notebook, which, while a challenge at first, ended up being extremely beneficial in terms of my memorization and deeper understanding. Finally, my way of thinking about geology shifted. Being able to see geological concepts in person instead of a textbook allowed for better conceptualization and understanding. This also applied to the many organisms that we saw."

I'm very grateful to both of them for their patience and kindness, and I think that both Alex and Jen encouraged students to be curious beyond the scope of grades and academics, which is an incredibly valuable life skill. I would definitely keep the tours led by Alex and Jen, and I think the lecture style of students writing down what the instructors say in field notebooks prepared students for real-life scientific study. Alex and Jen worked incredibly well together, and stayed calm in situations of stress and exhaustion that naturally come during a monthlong program full of activities. I especially noticed that Jen payed close attention to the mental and physical health of all students, and was always the first to offer to accompany a student to a health facility, check on students who seem to be unwell, and ensure that all students are fed, healthy, and happy. Both the instructor and the TA made this course fun, safe, and intellectually challenging, and I believe they have done a fantastic job with this program."

I enjoyed being constantly going from place to place, exploring as much as we could in the month together.

Our style of learning was hands-on, literally - we touched leaves, bark, insects, and even animals - and I think this learning style enabled students of all styles of learning to gain knowledge from the course. Furthermore, I loved the discussion-style reviews hosted by the instructors at each location. These sessions facilitated conversation and pondering beyond the scopes of the information covered by the course, and encouraged students to read through their notes and think critically about what they understood and where they might need clarification. Additionally, both Alex (the instructor) and Jen (the TA) brought a wide range of background knowledge to the program, and taught us important about biological and geological processes that are not part of the syllabus but nonetheless incredibly valuable scientific skills.

We didn't learn species from pictures in a textbook, we learned them from hiking through the Australia and seeing the plants in their natural environments, we learned about the fish by swimming in lakes and and the Great Barrier Reef and seeing the species swimming below us, and about the animals by going to see them in person. We learned about the history of Australia by going to the locations where that history happened and we learned about the history and practices of the Aboriginal people by talking to them and reading about their stories.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Throughout the Earth Science course, I, as a learner, developed a comprehensive understanding of various geological processes and phenomena. One of the key insights I gained pertains to the intricate interplay between Earth's internal forces and external influences, shaping the planet's dynamic features. This involved delving into the mechanics of plate tectonics, seismic activity, and volcanic processes, allowing me to appreciate the profound impact these forces have on the Earth's surface. Additionally, I honed my skills in interpreting and analyzing geological data, such as maps, cross-sections, and rock formations. This enhanced my ability to decipher the Earth's history and provided practical knowledge applicable to real-world scenarios, like identifying potential natural hazards or understanding the formation of valuable resources. Lastly, the course fostered a systems thinking approach, encouraging me to view the Earth as a complex, interconnected system where changes in one component can have cascading effects on the entire planet. This holistic perspective is invaluable for addressing contemporary environmental challenges and underscores the importance of responsible stewardship of our planet."

I know STEM classes don’t usually make attendance required but I really think that doing so for labs AND lectures would make the class a much better environment. I would also consider having three tests instead of two because I think the first test had a little too much material covered and splitting the course into three exams instead of two may also keep students more engaged. I would also even say that if students are treating the class like a blow off and not attending, just fail them. The content is so interesting and Prof. Glass has so much to say, but having a disinterested class that barely attends, never asks questions, doesn’t participate, etc really does harm the overall learning environment. Also, I hope Prof. Glass teaches the class on macro-evolutionary trends in the fossil record in the future!! Even if just a few highly interested students take it I feel like it is still worth it! I am going abroad in the fall but if it does by chance run next spring, I would 100% take it."

Specifically, this class helped me build a good enough level of knowledge of each aspect of the climate system to a point that I can now understand the jargon and concepts - and thus broadly understand scientific papers or discussions on the subject. 
Concepts that struck me:
1. Aerosols can help reduce global warming (in some cases)! Now I finally understand the discussions on geoengineering
2. The science of coral bleaching and the importance of the ocean system in balancing our climate.
3. How complex it all actually is! I knew that it was but this course helped me understand why."

Furthermore, I found that as an engineer, we are always wanting to problem solve, but sometimes, as in the case with BP spill - the best method is to do nothing at all and that engineered solutions may exacerbate the issue (dispersants)."

1. Lecture is not always a lecture. It is something to facilitate class discussion. The fact that any student can chime in to ask question is great.
2. I loved that the class did not require a paper. It is helpful to do one, but grad classes are heavy and discussions usually serve the purpose of learning.
3. I loved that we got to present on our own interested pollution issue and invite the author to speak to the class. I have never done that before.
4. I loved that the class was small so I was comfortable speaking up."

Honestly, the simple act of offering tea during class made it feel so much more relaxed and discussion based that it felt less of a requirement to participate in the course, but more of an opportunity.

But maybe it would be cool if we had an opportunity to brainstorm our own energy solutions to the problems that haven't been solved yet"

Also, the class structure is purely dependent on PowerPoint lectures, which can be monotonous. However, it is a really good class if you're interested in learning the science, physics, and math behind energy generation and different forms of energy. All in all, I think the class had great potential but just needed more interaction. Lastly, the class itself is not super hard, but it's important to pay close attention to lectures for the test."

I would also even say that if students are treating the class like a blow off and not attending, just fail them. The content is so interesting and Prof. Glass has so much to say, but having a disinterested class that barely attends, never asks questions, doesn’t participate, etc really does harm the overall learning environment.

My favorite, and in my opinion, most important area of knowledge that I received was regarding the history of Australia, its colonization, and the existence and cultural contexts of the aboriginal peoples that were first here. To fully understand and appreciate an area, a foundation of historical analysis must be first established. I strongly enjoyed learning about many of the holistic purposes of the land, how it was affected after/during colonization, and why Australia is the way it now is. It encouraged me to consider the causes and effects of human impact. 
2. I appreciated the hands-on teaching of this course. Specifically, days in which we were able to observe marine life (such as the Bondi Beach walk, Great Barrier Reef snorkel, etc.). It allowed me to fully get a grasp on my environment 
3. I have never used a field notebook in the way I have before this class. I believe that the use of a notebook and having to actively write in it while doing activities forced me to be much more attentive and engaged.

Secondly, I learned about basic classification for animals and plants, including Phylums and Subphylums, as well as plant reproductive strategies. Lastly, I learned how to travel and take care of myself in a foreign country by using public transport, shopping for groceries, and finding my way around unfamiliar cities.

The majority of them have been assigned to finding restaurants and making meals. Throughout the program, my confidence grew and developed, and the meals were difficult to adventure through the cities alone and manage my time effectively. Another skill that I developed was studying with limited wifi. Some of the locations had minimal wifi, so it was important to be able to study effectively using my notebook, which, while a challenge at first, ended up being extremely beneficial in terms of my memorization and deeper understanding. Finally, my way of thinking about geology shifted. Being able to see geological concepts in person instead of a textbook allowed for better conceptualization and understanding. This also applied to the many organisms that we saw."

Our style of learning was hands-on, literally - we touched leaves, bark, insects, and even animals - and I think this learning style enabled students of all styles of learning to gain knowledge from the course. Furthermore, I loved the discussion-style reviews hosted by the instructors at each location. These sessions facilitated conversation and pondering beyond the scopes of the information covered by the course, and encouraged students to read through their notes and think critically about what they understood and where they might need clarification. Additionally, both Alex (the instructor) and Jen (the TA) brought a wide range of background knowledge to the program, and taught us important about biological and geological processes that are not part of the syllabus but nonetheless incredibly valuable scientific skills.

We didn't learn species from pictures in a textbook, we learned them from hiking through the Australia and seeing the plants in their natural environments, we learned about the fish by swimming in lakes and and the Great Barrier Reef and seeing the species swimming below us, and about the animals by going to see them in person. We learned about the history of Australia by going to the locations where that history happened and we learned about the history and practices of the Aboriginal people by talking to them and reading about their stories.

I liked how the course was structured - each chapter focused on one aspect of the climate system (atmosphere, hydrosphere, etc) and went into a good level of depth without subjecting us to the physics and chemistry of it. Specifically, this class helped me build a good enough level of knowledge of each aspect of the climate system to a point that I can now understand the jargon and concepts - and thus broadly understand scientific papers or discussions on the subject. 
Concepts that struck me:
1. Aerosols can help reduce global warming (in some cases)! Now I finally understand the discussions on geoengineering
2. The science of coral bleaching and the importance of the ocean system in balancing our climate.
3. How complex it all actually is! I knew that it was but this course helped me understand why."

I think what would have been interesting is having students state their understandings and beliefs of climate change at the beginning of the class and walk through how these understandings were right or wrong. This could be submitted anonymously so students wouldn't feel called out.

Also, when Shindell talked about case studies and current events (ex. American politics, the influence of fossil fuel companies, country plans for decarbonization). I want to be challenged more. The class was just too easy, and I wish we could learn some modeling or do political analyses of climate policy or something tangible."

It is really useful for dispeling climate denialist myths, although those are becoming less important with time. If you're looking to develop climate solutions, this course won't teach you the technical or economic skills to do that. however, it is a good foundation to learn why things are the way they are. This course is about the breadth of climate change physics and policy, but not necessarily the depth of any specific tools."
