Specifically when Nico and John talked about their own work or research in their labs as opposed to just the big fundamentals of climate issues. The more specific the content we were covering and the more personal experience each professor had in the subject, the more engaging it was.

I liked that the professors balanced the content to include scientific and political perspectives on each issue. The case studies were also a stimulating way to interact with these issues from a stakeholder's perspective and discuss as a class.

Brian is great. The course is not hard, but there is more work than you expect at some points. 90% of the time you just need to engage with the material and SHOW UP TO CLASS, but every few weeks you’d need to put more time into the class to turn in an assignment.

Marine social science actually seems like it could be a really interesting field so don't let uninteresting lectures or professors keep you from learning about it.

It teaches you valuable ways of thinking about the world and what it's like to work in marine science. The trip to Beaufort is a great field experience. In my experience, the a lot of the lectures were hard to follow and some of the grading was a bit harsh. However, it's the kind of class where you eventually figure out what's going on/what the professor wants you to understand, and this makes everything a lot easier."

It taught me to consider all of those impacted and that an issue is rarely ever black and white, and that neither of the opposing sides are bad people.

I also want to take a moment to sing the praises of ""settling in."" Doing this practice every class, especially since this class was always my first class of the day, helped establish focus, calmness, and readiness to learn for the day.

I thought that each module provided new information and that later modules built on what we had learned in previous ones. I also really liked that Meagan brought in a few guest lecturers to speak about their work, as these talks gave a sense of some tangible ways that marine science can be studied in the real world--we weren't just learning the theory, but also what we could potentially go on to do with the theory we were learning in this class. Additionally, I think the way that the exams are laid out is very fair and constructive to our learning of the material; exams 1 and 2 comprehensively tested us on the knowledge we learned in the first 2 modules (and I really appreciated the note sheets we were allowed to have, and thought that making them provided a great way to study), while the final exam is a really cool way to get us to think about what we've gotten out of this class. Finally, and most importantly, I cannot speak highly enough about the field trip to the Marine Lab--I'm a senior, and this field trip has been one of my top 5 experiences at Duke!! The field trip was SO cool and fun, and I especially liked that it was centered on hands-on learning."

There were also several guest speakers that provided examples of real-life applications of the material taught in class. The professor was always clear with lectures, exams, and directions. The professor was always accessible in class and outside of class."

For this same reason the megafauna in the news forum should be kept.Definitely keep the Marine Lab field trip– I feel like I learned so much there between the turtle necropsy, Bonehenge, and the walk around Carot Island. I also liked when Dr. Andy Read came and talked about vaquita ""wicked problem"" – it's a good way to discover issues beyond fishing entanglement and into the underlying factors that affect conservation in the real world"

Often, these discussions were useless as no one understood the lesson given that day. The professor typically just read off the slides and the only visuals offered were highly academic graphs illustrating abstract theories of policy. I found the most stimulating class to be our very last class, when small groups gave mini lessons to each other. These lessons included audience engagement and included tangible problems relating to marine policy, rather than abstract theories of policy that mean nothing to us as students who have never engaged with the topic before. I also found it difficult to get feedback on our assignments. I'd often ask the professor about his expectations or advise for writing policy briefs, and he'd say he didn't have time to help. I ultimately found help in other sources, but found it frustrating that he didn't offer more guidance on our assignments that made up such a large portion of our grades, especially with it being a class of only 12 students."

A lot of the content felt theoretical, and it would have been beneficial to include more grounded topics. It also felt like we spent a lot of time on the same few topics (stakeholder engagement and the policy cycle in particular) which are important but seemed like they could have been covered in the same detail in a shorter and more engaging way."
