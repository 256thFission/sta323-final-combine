None of the topics were too complex to understand even if you hadn't taken organic chemistry. I appreciated how we began with the basics of medicinal chemistry (like what it was, the important factors medicinal chemists use when synthesizing new drugs, optimization, etc.) and then moved on to studying different drug classes.

Michael was also great at combining people from various music backgrounds: some students had extensive experience playing music and/or listening to Pink Floyd while others did not. Given the broad range of perspectives, the conversations in class felt very well-rounded. I also loved the albums that were chosen and the order we listened to them in.
