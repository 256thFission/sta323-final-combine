Something that could make this course more intellectually stimulating is if the class environment was more conducive to everyone/anyone being able to talk, as opposed to allowing some class conversations to be monopolized by a few people - i.e. efforts to bring in other voices too"

They were more dynamic and allowed us to incorporate a lot of skills we personally had. It gave us an organization or community to reach out to, which helped. I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy."" I think the final paper was kind of shoved in there at the end, but I much prefer that over any final exam."

Overall though, if you have any interest in theater or management the class is very interesting. If you have no background in theater the class does cover most of what you would need to know. The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

This course has showed me that there is so much more to movement and capturing movement than people usually think.
2- I learned to find inspiration in other peoples' works. Throughout the course, I watched the works of my classmates, which have been amazing, and as I learned more about their experiences, I learned to reinterpret my own and express them through film.
3- Collaboration is necessary. Dance film is the kind of hybrid work that requires working across different fields, therefore bridging them and that connection can only be me through other people."

The first one we did felt like enough. If we had done two, I think it may have been too much.I was especially engaged with the text activation about the punching, slashing, floating, etc. that Professor Wilbur offered. It was an incredibly useful visual that I return to when thinking about my word choices and each position I take in a paper.I really appreciated the alteration of the classroom setup. It was mentally stimulating to sit in a new spot every day and it helped me get connected to other students in class.The accountability structure for the final project was well-timed for me. I grew more comfortable with sharing work in the development stages, which I feel made my paper stronger."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","As a hardcore STEM enthusiast, I never in my life thought I would sit through a small public policy seminar during my first semester of college. But, looking in retrospect, this seminar was my one of my favorite classes that I have taken. First, I learned to think outside the ""norm."" During class, we called our professors by their first names and sat on bean bags and wool carpets instead of chairs. We had wild discussions ranging from prison abolition to using our body to connect with our thoughts (""dance is thought""). These discussions made me think outside the box and realize that if I continue to imagine the seemingly radical ideas, maybe one day it will become a reality. Secondly, I learned how to analyze texts and lead discussions/debates that differed from my personal, political, and ethical views. Our discussion section was very close-knit and welcoming, and I learned to value not only sharing my own opinions but also listening to other's viewpoints and peacefully debating controversial topics. Finally, I learned the value of exploring various ways to approach radical ideas. For instance, throughout class, we used our body to get in touch with our radical view of the world. This was very stimulating and eye-opening in that movement can change our thoughts and be used as a vehicle to explore the most radical ideas that are subconsciously in our brain."

We were lead in an exercise typically meant to bridge the gap between body and mind and use our imaginations to do so. We were challenged to do movements we've never felt before and experience new feelings. The instructors used these exercises to expand our imaginations. We learned what it was like to imagine new ideas from the texts that we read in class and how people in the past have really thought outside of the box in order to address social injustices.

I have always battled internally whether my movements lead to my dance moves or my movements led to the feeling of liberation I always have when I'm dancing. But through this course, I realized that dance is purely just my thinking; movement is thought. This course taught me how to view my dancing career and also imagine for liberation.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","As a hardcore STEM enthusiast, I never in my life thought I would sit through a small public policy seminar during my first semester of college. But, looking in retrospect, this seminar was my one of my favorite classes that I have taken. First, I learned to think outside the ""norm."" During class, we called our professors by their first names and sat on bean bags and wool carpets instead of chairs. We had wild discussions ranging from prison abolition to using our body to connect with our thoughts (""dance is thought""). These discussions made me think outside the box and realize that if I continue to imagine the seemingly radical ideas, maybe one day it will become a reality. Secondly, I learned how to analyze texts and lead discussions/debates that differed from my personal, political, and ethical views. Our discussion section was very close-knit and welcoming, and I learned to value not only sharing my own opinions but also listening to other's viewpoints and peacefully debating controversial topics. Finally, I learned the value of exploring various ways to approach radical ideas. For instance, throughout class, we used our body to get in touch with our radical view of the world. This was very stimulating and eye-opening in that movement can change our thoughts and be used as a vehicle to explore the most radical ideas that are subconsciously in our brain."

One quote from Brookes and the reading that will forever stick with me is ""dance is thought."" As a dancer, this quote stays in my heart as I perform and practice every time. I have always battled internally whether my movements lead to my dance moves or my movements led to the feeling of liberation I always have when I'm dancing. But through this course, I realized that dance is purely just my thinking; movement is thought. This course taught me how to view my dancing career and also imagine for liberation. As the professors said, radical imaginations are always needed for real change."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","As a hardcore STEM enthusiast, I never in my life thought I would sit through a small public policy seminar during my first semester of college. But, looking in retrospect, this seminar was my one of my favorite classes that I have taken. First, I learned to think outside the ""norm."" During class, we called our professors by their first names and sat on bean bags and wool carpets instead of chairs. We had wild discussions ranging from prison abolition to using our body to connect with our thoughts (""dance is thought""). These discussions made me think outside the box and realize that if I continue to imagine the seemingly radical ideas, maybe one day it will become a reality. Secondly, I learned how to analyze texts and lead discussions/debates that differed from my personal, political, and ethical views. Our discussion section was very close-knit and welcoming, and I learned to value not only sharing my own opinions but also listening to other's viewpoints and peacefully debating controversial topics. Finally, I learned the value of exploring various ways to approach radical ideas. For instance, throughout class, we used our body to get in touch with our radical view of the world. This was very stimulating and eye-opening in that movement can change our thoughts and be used as a vehicle to explore the most radical ideas that are subconsciously in our brain."

We were lead in an exercise typically meant to bridge the gap between body and mind and use our imaginations to do so. We were challenged to do movements we've never felt before and experience new feelings. The instructors used these exercises to expand our imaginations. We learned what it was like to imagine new ideas from the texts that we read in class and how people in the past have really thought outside of the box in order to address social injustices. The instructors gave us a good amount of reading material but let us interpret our own understanding in discussion posts. I think I would keep these same methods of instruction in the future, except that some weeks had a large amount of reading."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","As a hardcore STEM enthusiast, I never in my life thought I would sit through a small public policy seminar during my first semester of college. But, looking in retrospect, this seminar was my one of my favorite classes that I have taken. First, I learned to think outside the ""norm."" During class, we called our professors by their first names and sat on bean bags and wool carpets instead of chairs. We had wild discussions ranging from prison abolition to using our body to connect with our thoughts (""dance is thought""). These discussions made me think outside the box and realize that if I continue to imagine the seemingly radical ideas, maybe one day it will become a reality. Secondly, I learned how to analyze texts and lead discussions/debates that differed from my personal, political, and ethical views. Our discussion section was very close-knit and welcoming, and I learned to value not only sharing my own opinions but also listening to other's viewpoints and peacefully debating controversial topics. Finally, I learned the value of exploring various ways to approach radical ideas. For instance, throughout class, we used our body to get in touch with our radical view of the world. This was very stimulating and eye-opening in that movement can change our thoughts and be used as a vehicle to explore the most radical ideas that are subconsciously in our brain."

We were challenged to do movements we've never felt before and experience new feelings. The instructors used these exercises to expand our imaginations. We learned what it was like to imagine new ideas from the texts that we read in class and how people in the past have really thought outside of the box in order to address social injustices.

They were more dynamic and allowed us to incorporate a lot of skills we personally had. It gave us an organization or community to reach out to, which helped. I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy."" I think the final paper was kind of shoved in there at the end, but I much prefer that over any final exam."

The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

The topics, such as to express a certain emotion with one light design, are interesting and inspiring since it requires me to reflect on my emotional experience and to express it in a way that is understandable by others. However, the assignments are less open to students with a different perspective and aesthetic language than the majority of the student body since the assignments are graded based on how well it is perceived in the most general and common perspective."

I think that it is a good mix of the theory and applications of lighting design in theater. The class is not too much work, but provides you with opportunities to do a lot of extra experimentation on the projects if you are really interested in lighting design."

However, since light design does not require any specific skills, it is open to students with all levels and backgrounds. It is at a balance of artistic training and technical training, exposing students to both theatrical design and technology. The course functions well as an introduction into theatrical technology in general with lots of hand-on opportunities."

You need no experience to take the class, and also you can make your projects as advanced as you want depending on your level and goals. For example, we had the option of whether to use moving lights or not."
