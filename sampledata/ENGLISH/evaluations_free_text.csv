I also appreciated how she elevated ""colloquial"" knowledge to the level of the academy (asking us, for example, to include hypertext and internet sources within our final paper, or bringing up the example of the online forum on dragons). This is something I haven't seen any other professor do before, and as someone who has a few reservations about the nature of literature and the academy, something I didn't take for granted.

Professor Lubiano is very intelligent but often struggles with conveying information, so her lectures are quite disjointed and convoluted. Many times, she would leave no room for students to speak during the entire 2.5-hour class. There was a lot of assigned reading, but, as stated, we rarely discussed them and were instead lectured at about them for 2.5 hours. And, as the lectures were so hard to follow anyway, it felt like doing the readings was pointless. If you’re looking to learn something about literature, look elsewhere. There are many other excellent professors in the English department with significantly more engaging methods of instruction."

The professor didn't use slides or organize his lectures beyond a basic chronology from the beginning of hip-hop to the present day. Because the professor cancelled so many classes, we never made it close to the present day and finished in the 1990s. There are podcasts about hip-hop that have to be better than this.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was a great introduction into understanding film on a more technical level! We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

Woolf was also great but I was less engaged in that novel due to personal time constraints).

The literary concepts you learn are very digestible, easy to understand (nothing overly-complex), and lots of time devoted to teaching them. Professor Mitchell is so engaging and fun, wants to see you do your best.

If you don't like to read, don't take this class. The readings were manageable, but some of the assigned chunks were pretty long. Also, Professor Ferraro is very extroverted, passionate, and not afraid to push his students out of their comfort zones in discussion. You need to be able to be bold in discussion and can't be afraid to respond to questions that have the rest of the class in silence. He is also a very realistic grader, you won't get an A+ just for writing a ""good"" paper. He is of the mindset that grades don't define us and shouldn't matter, but for many people they do matter a lot so if you're looking for an easy A+ this probably isn't it. He does give only within the B+ to A+ range, and he is very effort and improvement conscious."

He also focuses a lot on tiny word choices and sentence details at the beginning of the stories rather than analyzing the entire thing.

He is genuinely one of my favorite professors at Duke. You are missing out if you do not take a class with him. Amazing person and smart professor.

Dr. Sharma facilitated my learning by being honest. He is honestly critical, what some may phrase as ""brutally so."" On the first day of his class, I thought I would pass out from his glare alone. He's not scary, in fact, he'll likely be shorter than you. What makes his presence looming is he is completely in the moment. He is almost naked in his analysis of you as a person and writer. However, he may dress it up by not cussing. Through this method, he may appear 'cruel,' or 'harsh,' potentially, shall I say, disturbing? But he is none of those things. I would almost go as far as to say he's wise; though, he is unlikely to accept such an adjective. He cares too much about writing to pretend you're good at it, and too much to berate you as just bad--even though he will designate you as such in the beginning. He wants you to succeed, and he did that for me by being one of the most honest men I know."

Basically the format is that we write one writing assignment (differs between poems, a profile, or a fiction story based on what unit we are in) and then the entire 2.5 hour class is devoted to him critiquing people's work (we also have to recite a poem we memorize each week). It's not a hard class but you are randomly called on a lot."

Dr. Sharma is one of the most interesting people I've ever met. His personality is different from any other professor I've met. Take his criticism and critique as a challenge to get better and you will. Please actually do the writings and read your classmate's work. It makes the class so much more interesting and fun. You form a good community throughout the semester. The more effort you put in, the more you will improve, but Dr. Sharma will do his best to make you a better writer no matter what."

If you don't like writing at all then don't take it, obviously, but if you actually enjoy creative writing and reading other people's stuff than go for it. It's a hilarious, super-fun class to take and honestly was the highlight of my freshman spring. It teaches you how to take harsh criticism if you aren't used to it already, but you need to remember nearly EVERYONE will get critiqued harshly and it is NEVER presented in a way that is mean or ill-mannered. And you NEED that criticism to learn. Writing doesn't improve if you're in an echo chamber of people too afraid to tell you about your shortcomings."

Professor Sharma does a great job of pointing out weaknesses in writing. 
He's going to be **jokingly** rude, don't the teasing seriously. 
Be assertive and ask questions. You get more out of the course what *you* put into it. Trust me."

I do think, however, that there was a sense of ""this is right, this is wrong"" attitude to many of the comments, which I felt went completely against the whole idea of a ""creative"" writing class. Many of us are not writers (usually stem), so if we are told it's wrong by the prof we will instantly listen and do whatever will please the prof best without even thinking twice. However, I think it is more important to rationalise with the students why they made a decision on their writing, and what would be some alternatives, because suggestions are made to be considered, but they are always up to the writer themselves to take them or leave them. I also think that feeling able to defend one's work should be a part of the course, rather than simply feeling forced to take and accept the suggestions. Furthermore, I do not think anyone should use argument by authority such as being published or having worked with famous people etc in order to dismiss students' artistic choices, without even allowing us to justify ourselves."

The most important thing that I learned in this class is the way that we should look at the world with a writer's eye. We did one specific activity where we were released from class to record everything that we could from our five senses from our favorite spot on campus. Sitting in one place for an hour(ish) just to write everything down that we see, heard, smelled, tasted, and felt like a big task that was going to go by very slowly. But sitting there, in that spot, I found inspiration for so much of the writing that I did during the semester. It is amazing how when you look at the commonplace, what we observe around us everyday that doesn't seem that extraordinary, how much material you can really find. Without Toby's guidance and focus on this with our seed journals, I would never have realized how easy it was to find inspiration for our writing."

It gives me a chance to share any insights I make from the readings and hear what other insights the people around me might have made that I missed. Therefore giving me a more understanding perspective of each reading that I discuss with others around me. It helped me learn better about the different components in class. Also doing an actual D&D one-shot helped me understand what we talked about in class about the subject and how it connects to the fantasy genre.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was a great introduction into understanding film on a more technical level! We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

Stay on top of your long script at the end, though. Checkpoints are built into the class, so don't get behind on them, because that 80 page script is very manageable if broken up over multiple weeks, but very scary if you've let it pile up!"

If you have no experience in writing or theater and want a fun and rewarding creative outlet, take this class. Come to class ready to engage with your peers' scripts, but that may not even need to be said because everyone in the class was eager to read each others' scripts. The only possible reason I can fathom that someone wouldn't be satisfied with this class is if they didn't put in any effort; this was not the case of anyone I know who's taken it, but I suppose in the abstract it is theoretically possible. I would STILL encourage that person to take this class because even shy or ""too-cool-for-the-arts"" students will get a kick out of this class.

It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at Duke. To be fair, I already knew I loved Shakespeare before I took the class, but it seems like even students who weren’t as experienced with Shakespeare enjoyed the class. You will have to do a lot of reading— it helps if you watch the plays instead of just reading them (take advantage of Duke Libraries’ access to wonderful productions by companies like the RSC, Stratford Festival of Canada, and Globe Theater), but also have a copy with good notes in the margins (like the Folger or Arden edition). There are only two major written assignments, which means that each one counts a lot in your grade, but I didn’t mind because it meant that for most of the course we could focus on reading the plays and discussing them in class."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

The exams were very fair and the expectations were clear– as long as I attended every class, listened carefully, took good notes, and studied them in detail, I was prepared. Because he grades the exams on a curve, using the highest grade in the class as the standard for an A, if there is any material that the class as a whole does not understand, no one is penalized for it. I did not write the optional term paper because I was satisfied with my exam grades, but it seemed like a good option for anyone who might have struggled with the exams and preferred to have an opportunity to write a paper.

You would be hard-pressed to find a professor at Duke who is as passionate and knowledgeable about early 20th-century American literature, not to mention as experienced and legendary, as Victor Strandberg is. Even though some of the authors we studied are not my favorite (Hemingway, Faulkner, Updike), I truly enjoyed the lectures and appreciated the opportunity to learn more about this pivotal moment in American literary history. One interesting part of this course is that unlike most English classes, which are writing-based, center on discussions, and encourage you to develop your own opinions, this course is exam-based and is mostly about listening to lectures, memorizing as much as you can, and repeating what was said in class on each of the exams. One of my friends who took the class with me joked that she was losing her ability to think for herself, and to a limited extent, I agreed, but it was nice to take this course that was a different structure than the other English classes I was taking. Even though my interpretations of the readings were very much guided by what Professor Strandberg believed, I didn't doubt his ideas, given that he is such an expert, and I still developed my own opinions, just in a different course structure than I was used to."

It was very interesting how each philosopher's circumstances drove their thinking, and how that thinking was able to be built upon and developed over time throughout many more eras and philosophers. And it was all about arguably the most important question one can ask themselves: what is the meaning of life?

It was definitely a new way of thinking about literature that I have read or heard about, how to read closely on literature works, and how to approach existential questioning."

I also enjoyed the lectures of this course and being able to learn from Professor Moi's knowledge on the subject alongside responses to questions from students.

There are a lot of texts, most of them difficult to get through and at a fast pace at that. There are also essays to write, and they are great opportunities to better understand the texts and improve your own writing. This is a class that is best experienced if you have existential thoughts yourself or are interested in learning about it. I think that is what motivates one to get through books by Nietzsche, Doestoevsky, Heidegger, etc."

Being able to stop and think about one's meaning and place in the world is probably something everyone thinks about at some point in their life, so exploring how others have thought of this question is not only helpful for one's own search, but also helps to establish a new way of thinking. I think that this class helped me immensely with this. The class is a lot of reading as you read a book a week, but all for good reason. If you can manage the amount reading and can spend time on it, it will allow you to make more out of the class and be able to make more connections and develop your own ideas. The grading is pretty vague, but seems to be mostly participation based along with three papers throughout the semester."

I also recommend annotating the text and taking notes, as this will help when writing essays later on as well as to get a better grip and recollection of the material."

However, I think as we progressed throughout the class and saw the ways these genres could show up in more modern ways like with race in the bondwoman's narrative or with trauma in Get Out, I had more appreciation for this way of reading."

There's a lot of reading involved but the improvement to your writing is second to none. You just have to be willing to put in the work.This isn't my first class with JP, I feel like in comparison to the other classes I've taken with him this one was just as if not more challenging and engaging than the other classes I've taken with him. It definitely made me approach my writing differently than I usually do, both for the assignments and the freewriting."

I thought I was going to struggle and that I would probably end up with a bad grade. While I don't know my grade, I thought this class taught me a lot about writing and how to express my ideas in an interesting, cohesive, and well structured manner. I found the Chrachter Sketch to be the hardest assignemnt. After the charachter study, I started getting inspiration for a sketch from various sources, and the sketch suffered from my lack of experience in organizing does thoughts/ideas."

If you're novel writers, provide context separately and if your short story writers make sure all that they need to know is there."

Was there any assignment for which you felt unprepared, or about which you felt confused?this was my first creative writing course, but I have been a creative writer for my whole life, so I didn't find the assignments particularly challenging.

It was such a fun class.Additional Comments: The course was definitely challenging in the sense that it asked me to write ""types"" of characters that I had never written before (i.e. villains). Moreover, a lot of the exercises we did in class, e.g. asking us to rewrite a passage from a different lens or to continue from the end of one, challenged the way I normally go about writing."

As a creative writing minor, I was enrolled in several writing courses this semester, so I was worried I would not be able to produce my best work in Professor Gritton's course. However, I found both the structure of the course and Professor Gritton himself to be extremely supportive and applicable to my other writing workshops/courses. I could take what I learned in ""Anti-Villains"" and supplement the work I was doing both outside the classroom and within others. I highly recommend taking a class from Professor Gritton. His passion for writing and care for his students are palpable, and I learned a lot from him about character development, dialogue, and creative writing in general."

This class was fun & engaging, and I learned a great deal. Not overly demanding, the class is a breath of fresh air, especially if you're looking for a break from the usual STEM classes. It certainly made me a better reader & writer. Professor Gritton is an excellent instructor who will help you improve your writing to meet any of your goals - I'd say this class is very ""you get out what you put in""."

Professor Martinez de las Rivas organizes the class in a way that allows us to hone skills in poetry writing, poetry analysis, and collaborative work in with the goal of identifying the strengths and weaknesses of poetry of others' and our own. He indirectly also develops introspective skills in his students as he challenged us to use our thoughts as an archive that would serve as an inspiration for our writing. I truly feel I learned a lot about myself in this class, which was unexpected. I also developed an appreciation for the things around me that have always seemed mundane, whether it be a crack in the sidewalk in the gardens or a (respectfully) crazy lady in a herbarium...."

Focusing on the persona poems, you are really able to think critically about the language you are using and how that can be improved. Poetry, after all, is an expression of language. He was an instructor that goes above and beyond to help his students, and spends so much time helping you improve if you would like to.

I also learned in his class that if you want to get more one-on-one time, more feedback, or life advice in general, schedule office hours with him.

The field trips inspired me to write different poems and it able to learn about Duke during these trips as well which is something that I appreciate. The class discussions that were led by Toby were also very insightful because I got to learn about poetry from an actual poet.

Something that was really enjoyable for me was our trip to the Rubenstein Library where we all got to pull our own items from the archive and spend as much time with them as we wanted to gain inspiration and insight. Also the class is most effective when it's this size. I don't think I would have gained the same things from this class if there were more students."

Some of the methods we used in our writing were out of the ordinary; for example, writing poems based on tarot cards or ""cut-up"" writing where we took words from other published works and manipulated them in our own way. It was rarely, probably never, an assignment of ""go write a poem,"" there was always something more behind it. I was amazed at the way that anything could serve as an archive. Whether it's our conscious thoughts, unconscious thoughts, the things we have in our pockets, the walls in our room, the Duke Gardens... everything really. It was always a pleasant challenge to see what other places and things I could identify as an archive for the sake of my writing. A lot of this ended up being my own thoughts, which led to a lot of unexpected self-reflection and insight."

Professor Amin taught us how a novel works. Throughout the class, we read multiple books and each one we analyzed from the perspective of a writer. We talked about different strategies the authors used, why they worked, why they didn't, etc. It is worth noting too, that each book was different. That is, through our discussion of them, we learned how different genres operate, and how writers within those genres create a coherent story that works and sells. After that, we moved on to learning about how to create a novel. Amin put us through rigorous exercises (I wouldn't have it any other way) and through each one we learned more and more about what to do to create an effective story that is compelling and most importantly, works. We did numerous workshops and in those we all gave feedback to one another, and now that the class is all said and done, I can say that I can start a novel. I know what it takes to write a good story, and I can recognize good writing and a good story when I see it. This class was transformational for me, especially as someone who wants to write for the rest of my life."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Learned how there are a multitude of stories behind language, terminology, and our understanding of the environment. 
2. The origin of colonialism and the anthropocene, and how this history shapes our modern outlooks on the environment and environmental justice. (Example - reviewing the influence of darwinism and what is ""natural"" and ""just"", etc.)
3. Narratives matter, and there are many of them. The differences between writers such as Locke, Darwin, Thoreau, Simmard, Kimmerer, Marsh, and more are astounding and reflect different understandings of the right of humans to take from this Earth and ultimately what the consequences of this become. These highlight how environmental issues cannot be divorced from questions of power, ethics, and equity. These different narratives allows us to evaluate historical paradigms (like commodification of nature) in context of the issues of today. These narratives show that environmental justice is not a single story and its ever-evolving to include and prioritize different ecological and social living systems. 
4. Environmental justice is not just about nature or wilderness. It's not just about economic opportunity. It's everything that surrounds us. It's about recognizing the right of everyone and everything, and the impact it leaves on everything else. It's about recognizing marginalized communities and preservation of spaces. It's about policymaking that reflects a commitment to the well-being of all things, as all things are interrelated. It shows the interconnected framework that integrates social equity, ecological health, and the well-being of all living systems. Environmental justice transcends any single issue. At its core, environmental justice is about reimagining the boundaries of ""us""/""them""/""we"" and instead honoring the reciprocity that must come with our globe through shared responsibility."

For example, the day after the election was solely a time to reflect and she let us talk about whatever we wanted instead of ""having"" to do the exercises associated with the readings for that day. I also particularly loved that the class was outside most of the time in the gardens and around Duke/Durham. Keep all methods of instruction.

I haven't taken a non-stem class since my freshman year, so I was a little apprehensive coming into an English class, whether it would be interesting to me, if I would be able to succeed (since analyzing literature was never my strong suite), and whatnot. But this class quickly dispelled those fears. I very much enjoyed reading for the first time classics such as The Great Gatsby, Winter Dreams, Absolution, and The Scarlet Letter. It's not an easy A class in the sense that, you need to put in genuine effort into your essays, but they are graded fairly, and work put in is rewarded."

Professor Lubiano is very intelligent but often struggles with conveying information, so her lectures are quite disjointed and convoluted. Many times, she would leave no room for students to speak during the entire 2.5-hour class. There was a lot of assigned reading, but, as stated, we rarely discussed them and were instead lectured at about them for 2.5 hours. And, as the lectures were so hard to follow anyway, it felt like doing the readings was pointless. If you’re looking to learn something about literature, look elsewhere. There are many other excellent professors in the English department with significantly more engaging methods of instruction."

It hardly ever met, there were no opportunities to test our knowledge, and there were no assignments besides the final. The professor didn't use slides or organize his lectures beyond a basic chronology from the beginning of hip-hop to the present day. Because the professor cancelled so many classes, we never made it close to the present day and finished in the 1990s. There are podcasts about hip-hop that have to be better than this.

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

Creative Engagement with Archival Material: Through our exposure to artists, writers, and scholars who use the archive as both material and metaphor, I developed new ways of thinking about memory, storytelling, and resistance. The course showed me how archives can be reimagined through poetry, performance, and visual art.
Diasporic and Transnational Thinking: I learned to think across geographies and histories—connecting the Black experience in the U.S., South Africa, and other parts of the diaspora. The course challenged me to think about the global entanglements of anti-Blackness and creative survival."

With each of the readings, I was introduced to a new idea or theory about the Black archive.2) redefining my ideas of the Black archive: this course really expanded my thinking about what an archive could be. I  enjoyed how we looked at different forms of archiving such as film, photography, and even forms of non-materiality like the ocean.3) interdisciplinary archival methods: I  really enjoyed this interdisciplinary class.

This coupled with the alternative forms of archival memory (photography, play writing, filmmaking, etc.) will definitely be useful in my disseration writing. 
Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis. We were able to tailor our questions or responses to the creator of said texts, rather than spending time on speculating possibilities of textual analysis. I found this interview style of class to be highly beneficial to my appreciation of what we were learning, and it further birthed analytical queries as to what the text entailed.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, this course introduced me to archival work in the practical, applied definition of the term. I was essentially going in blind although with the understanding that the archival process was (and is) front and center in my research and scholarly aspirations more generally. Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

Additionally, the professors brought in some guest lecturers for some classes, and we were able to take a trip to the Schomburg library in New York City. I really enjoyed all the parts of the class! I liked how the readings included both classics in Black archival thought and some emerging research and artworks. These ideas were all new to me, even though I had taken classes about archives before. I suppose those focused more on literature by white people. However, these readings were all engaging and expanded my worldview a lot.

Creative Engagement with Archival Material: Through our exposure to artists, writers, and scholars who use the archive as both material and metaphor, I developed new ways of thinking about memory, storytelling, and resistance. The course showed me how archives can be reimagined through poetry, performance, and visual art.
Diasporic and Transnational Thinking: I learned to think across geographies and histories—connecting the Black experience in the U.S., South Africa, and other parts of the diaspora. The course challenged me to think about the global entanglements of anti-Blackness and creative survival."

With each of the readings, I was introduced to a new idea or theory about the Black archive.2) redefining my ideas of the Black archive: this course really expanded my thinking about what an archive could be. I  enjoyed how we looked at different forms of archiving such as film, photography, and even forms of non-materiality like the ocean.3) interdisciplinary archival methods: I  really enjoyed this interdisciplinary class.

This coupled with the alternative forms of archival memory (photography, play writing, filmmaking, etc.) will definitely be useful in my disseration writing. 
Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis. We were able to tailor our questions or responses to the creator of said texts, rather than spending time on speculating possibilities of textual analysis. I found this interview style of class to be highly beneficial to my appreciation of what we were learning, and it further birthed analytical queries as to what the text entailed. 
Finally, hearing the responses from my classmates as to their analysis of what had been covered that week was beneficial to my understanding of the text, and helped me to think through the class in a fulfilling manner."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, this course introduced me to archival work in the practical, applied definition of the term. I was essentially going in blind although with the understanding that the archival process was (and is) front and center in my research and scholarly aspirations more generally. Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

Creative Engagement with Archival Material: Through our exposure to artists, writers, and scholars who use the archive as both material and metaphor, I developed new ways of thinking about memory, storytelling, and resistance. The course showed me how archives can be reimagined through poetry, performance, and visual art.
Diasporic and Transnational Thinking: I learned to think across geographies and histories—connecting the Black experience in the U.S., South Africa, and other parts of the diaspora. The course challenged me to think about the global entanglements of anti-Blackness and creative survival."

With each of the readings, I was introduced to a new idea or theory about the Black archive.2) redefining my ideas of the Black archive: this course really expanded my thinking about what an archive could be. I  enjoyed how we looked at different forms of archiving such as film, photography, and even forms of non-materiality like the ocean.3) interdisciplinary archival methods: I  really enjoyed this interdisciplinary class.

This coupled with the alternative forms of archival memory (photography, play writing, filmmaking, etc.) will definitely be useful in my disseration writing. 
Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis. We were able to tailor our questions or responses to the creator of said texts, rather than spending time on speculating possibilities of textual analysis. I found this interview style of class to be highly beneficial to my appreciation of what we were learning, and it further birthed analytical queries as to what the text entailed.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, this course introduced me to archival work in the practical, applied definition of the term. I was essentially going in blind although with the understanding that the archival process was (and is) front and center in my research and scholarly aspirations more generally. Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

I learned to “read between the lines” and to think critically about whose stories are told—and whose are not.
Creative Engagement with Archival Material: Through our exposure to artists, writers, and scholars who use the archive as both material and metaphor, I developed new ways of thinking about memory, storytelling, and resistance. The course showed me how archives can be reimagined through poetry, performance, and visual art.
Diasporic and Transnational Thinking: I learned to think across geographies and histories—connecting the Black experience in the U.S., South Africa, and other parts of the diaspora. The course challenged me to think about the global entanglements of anti-Blackness and creative survival."

With each of the readings, I was introduced to a new idea or theory about the Black archive.2) redefining my ideas of the Black archive: this course really expanded my thinking about what an archive could be. I  enjoyed how we looked at different forms of archiving such as film, photography, and even forms of non-materiality like the ocean.3) interdisciplinary archival methods: I  really enjoyed this interdisciplinary class.

This coupled with the alternative forms of archival memory (photography, play writing, filmmaking, etc.) will definitely be useful in my disseration writing. 
Second, the guest speakers we periodically had in class helped to engage the class with the texts beyond surface-level analysis. We were able to tailor our questions or responses to the creator of said texts, rather than spending time on speculating possibilities of textual analysis. I found this interview style of class to be highly beneficial to my appreciation of what we were learning, and it further birthed analytical queries as to what the text entailed. 
Finally, hearing the responses from my classmates as to their analysis of what had been covered that week was beneficial to my understanding of the text, and helped me to think through the class in a fulfilling manner."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, this course introduced me to archival work in the practical, applied definition of the term. I was essentially going in blind although with the understanding that the archival process was (and is) front and center in my research and scholarly aspirations more generally. Our trip to the Schomburg Center,  as well as to the Rubenstein on a couple of occasions, really cultivated the feeling and process of archival practice from its most rudimentary to much more complex forms. In other words, the practical skills and methods referring to everything form applying for research profiles at the Schomburg to using finding aids to search for materials and beyond were all nurtured  by and through this course. But things do not just stop there. The theoretical knowledge gained in this course has been so vast that it would be nearly impossible to isolate one or two specific insights. I would say that this course cultivated a specific reading practice in me, which I intend to retain as I progress through my studies. Thinking archivally, and, specifically, thinking about the use of archival materials as forms of evidence, their placement in the texts we studied, the rhetorics built around them, and so forth, made me consistently consider the ethics of using the archives – especially those which such traumatic, heavy, or otherwise violence-laden sources. Although I certainly have room to improve, I feel like this course really required me to read closer than ever; to probe not only the arguments being presented, but also to scrutinize the archival sources being cited – often even trying to locate primary sources in order to compare and contextualize how certain citation were being implemented. Sometimes my discoveries were shocking with regard to certain decontextualized or otherwise heavily manipulated usages of primary material. In any case, I consider this a skill or even a reading method that I hope to transfer into my scholarship hence forth. Lastly, I have to mention the community of research fostered by this course. Through this course I have established working, collaborative friendships which I hope will persist. In my field, the caricature of the private, hermetic scholar still remains the more or less hegemonic image of what scholarship is or ought to be. This course absolutely challenged this image, and did so furthermore without resorting to the sorts of romanticized communities you often hear about in higher education. In a very material, working, and concrete sense, this class produced and actualized a real research community."

I liked how the readings included both classics in Black archival thought and some emerging research and artworks. These ideas were all new to me, even though I had taken classes about archives before. I suppose those focused more on literature by white people. However, these readings were all engaging and expanded my worldview a lot. The guest lecturers were all super nice in answering all of our questions and giving overviews of their work, which helped a lot in imagining how archival research can manifest in different genres of art. The trip to the Schomburg was also incredibly special.

Though I wish I had taken it in the first semester of my Ph.D. I think having had the first year to understand the particularities and cadences of a doctoral program made taking it in my second year the best time to do it. Writing is Thinking has made me a better writer, reader, and confident person as it relates to both. Receiving weekly feedback on my writing helped me hone in on my personal writing skills and begin to figure out how to change/adjust them. More than that, this class forced me to confront my anxieties around writing and my fears of being seen as not being good enough. Though neither of those has ""gone away"" per se, I am now more able to sit with them and take more responsibility for how I sometimes allow them to overwhelm me. Toril seems intimidating, but she is so deeply kind. So kind. Receiving consistent feedback and engagement with your writing and thinking from someone so deeply invested in both is not something that happens even 2% of the time in graduate school. Most people never receive that, and the few who do receive it too late. The class might feel scary, but you will be deeply cared for while not being coddled, and you will grow a lot in the process"

The beginning overview lectures were also a good touchstone, and a really helpful way to think broadly about the history of criticism or a specific critical approach. In terms of the assignments, what I found most useful was the abstract assignment, our mock conference (which, honestly, was so valuable we we could have spent more time scaffolding it even -- i.e., presenting abstracts & talking over conferences the week before, then holding the ""conference"" the following class), and the minor list assignment. In general, both the other students and Professor Stan were thoughtful and intellectually generous, and the class was an exciting and generative space to spend time in each week.

The largest skill I've learned throughout this course is to deeply engage with literary works. This course teaches you how to critically analyze themes and meanings that may not be obvious on the surface. This course has taught me how to question literature and how to interpret what the author is trying to express.

I've never met someone as enthusiastic to teach their content to a group of students. Professor McInnis truly cares about what is taught in class and the deep topics that we are analyzing. What made this course so amazing and fascinating was Professor McInnis. Each day, he would show up to class with enthusiasm to go over class readings. Professor McInnis was so knowledgeable about his field that I would often stay after class to ask him about specific passages or unique real world applications of what we go over in class, and he would always take the time to answer my questions thoroughly.Lastly, Professor McInnis would always make sure to find time to meet with me for office hours outside of class if I needed it. There are very few professors who would meet at 6:00 PM on a Friday to answer a students questions. It truly shows how much Professor McInnis cares about his students."

There would be times where no one would know what to say and he would be able to ask questions or direct us towards a better discussion. For example, when we were supposed to be discussing an experimental text by Randall Kenan, no one said anything because we were all confused by the structure of the reading.

Take the time to read every assigned reading thoroughly(even the optional ones). Each reading has a unique message or purpose. Secondly, don't be afraid to take a risk in discussion or writing and don't be afraid to question. On the blog posts, it can seem tempting to write about a surface level theme, but try to dig deeper and explore a complex theme. Professor McInnis loves when students have a unique perspective on a reading.Lastly, and maybe most importantly, get to know Professor McInnis. By getting to know Professor McInnis, you start to see how truly passionate he is about his work and his courses. When I flunched Professor McInnis, I got to ask all about his career and research. I got to see how knowledgeable he is in his field and how much he cares about what he teaches. By getting to know professor McInnis, I became very comfortable discussing topics with him during class, which made the class that much more engaging."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this course, I developed a more holistic understanding of medicine, moving beyond the rigid, science-focused perspective that dominates most of my other studies. I learned to view medicine through the lens of the humanities, realizing that understanding human experiences of illness, suffering, and healing requires more than just scientific knowledge. The course taught me that literature and the arts offer essential tools for developing empathy, which is critical in patient care. They not only foster compassion but also enhance our imagination and critical thinking, which are vital when dealing with complex or unconventional medical situations, such as in military settings. This expanded perspective has made me believe that the humanities are as crucial to medical practice as the hard sciences, helping us navigate the emotional and relational aspects of patient care that science alone cannot explain.
Additionally, the course sharpened my analytical skills and taught me the importance of engaging critically with materials. Instead of passively accepting the views presented in texts or media, I learned to question assumptions, contrast perspectives with my own medical experiences, and think critically about the information at hand. This skill has become especially valuable in a world where misinformation is rampant. Moreover, the course provided a unique collaborative learning environment, where I not only learned from the professor but also from my classmates, whose diverse backgrounds and experiences enriched my understanding of the material. Through this, I developed a deeper ability to listen carefully and empathetically, a skill that will be indispensable in my medical practice."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The overall learning environment of this class was shaped significantly by both the course structure and, more importantly, by Professor Apple’s teaching style. One component that stood out to me was the keyword readings, which were especially practical for understanding key concepts in medicine. Terms like “patient” were dissected in a way that revealed their complexity and depth, encouraging us to think critically about language and its implications in healthcare. These readings were invaluable in challenging our preconceived notions and reshaping the way we think about medical practice. The active class discussions that followed these readings further enriched my understanding. Engaging with peers in dialogue, guided by Professor Apple’s expertise, allowed us to explore various interpretations of the texts, connecting them to our own experiences in medicine. I think future iterations of the course could benefit from a balanced approach, perhaps a 50/50 split between didactic lectures and discussions. Having more time dedicated to exploring scholarly perspectives and Professor Apple’s own insights on the texts would be a great way to deepen our analysis and understanding.
However, the structure and components of the course were only part of what made it truly exceptional. Above all, it was Professor Apple’s character and teaching style that created a learning environment where I felt both intellectually challenged and personally inspired. Her positive attitude, enthusiasm, and the respect she showed for each student fostered a space of genuine curiosity and open dialogue. More than just teaching the course content, Professor Apple embodied the qualities of a compassionate, thoughtful, and ethical physician, and I learned just as much from her personal example as I did from the readings. A friend of mine from another university who sat in with me on one of her classes remarked that it was unlike any class he had ever experienced—highlighting the depth of the discussions and the dynamic group activities that Professor Apple facilitated. This feedback, along with my own experience, underscores her exceptional ability to teach and connect with students. Duke is fortunate to have such a dedicated and insightful instructor, and I believe future students will greatly benefit from the structure, content, and, most importantly, the teacher herself."

One of the most stimulating aspects was the class discussions themselves, where hearing from other students exposed me to perspectives I had not previously considered. These diverse viewpoints challenged my assumptions and expanded my thinking, emphasizing the value of deep listening in truly understanding complex issues. I came to realize that true comprehension does not always stem from agreeing with others, but rather from engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with their ideas. This ability to listen deeply and consider opposing perspectives is a crucial skill, both in medicine and in life.
Beyond the discussions, the readings chosen by Professor Apple were another key element of what made this class so intellectually enriching. The texts were not only thought-provoking but also incredibly relevant, as they delved into aspects of human behavior that are central to understanding the practice of medicine. These readings brought a practical dimension to our exploration, offering insights into how we can better understand and relate to patients, colleagues, and ourselves. They grounded theoretical ideas in real-world scenarios, making the intellectual experience both engaging and applicable. In this way, the course nicely combined rich intellectual content with practical applicability, creating a stimulating learning environment that was both deep and meaningful."

The exploration of literature and medicine offers profound insights into what it truly means to be a compassionate and ethical human being, which is valuable in any field. For pre-health students, the readings are particularly impactful, as they not only deepen your understanding of medical practice but also provide new perspectives on what it means to be a caring and empathetic doctor. The course challenges you to think beyond clinical skills, helping you reflect on the human side of medicine—how to truly listen to patients, understand their experiences, and approach care with both scientific knowledge and deep empathy. It’s a course that will not only shape you as a future healthcare provider but also as a more thoughtful, reflective individual."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",I think the instructors facilitated my learning by setting aside time in class to have me discuss often the readings we had to do before class. It gives me a chance to share any insights I make from the readings and hear what other insights the people around me might have made that I missed. Therefore giving me a more understanding perspective of each reading that I discuss with others around me. It helped me learn better about the different components in class. Also doing an actual D&D one-shot helped me understand what we talked about in class about the subject and how it connects to the fantasy genre.

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

It was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Duke. The readings are both thought-provoking and entertaining, as are the in-class discussions we had about them. By the end of the course, you'll be able to say that you're well-versed in modern European short fiction authors like Kafka, Joyce, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Mann, Sartre, Camus, etc. You get to do some cool out-of-class excursions too, like to the Rare Books library and the Nasher. The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently.

It was very interesting how each philosopher's circumstances drove their thinking, and how that thinking was able to be built upon and developed over time throughout many more eras and philosophers. And it was all about arguably the most important question one can ask themselves: what is the meaning of life?

I also enjoyed the lectures of this course and being able to learn from Professor Moi's knowledge on the subject alongside responses to questions from students.

There are a lot of texts, most of them difficult to get through and at a fast pace at that. There are also essays to write, and they are great opportunities to better understand the texts and improve your own writing. This is a class that is best experienced if you have existential thoughts yourself or are interested in learning about it. I think that is what motivates one to get through books by Nietzsche, Doestoevsky, Heidegger, etc."

Being able to stop and think about one's meaning and place in the world is probably something everyone thinks about at some point in their life, so exploring how others have thought of this question is not only helpful for one's own search, but also helps to establish a new way of thinking. I think that this class helped me immensely with this. The class is a lot of reading as you read a book a week, but all for good reason. If you can manage the amount reading and can spend time on it, it will allow you to make more out of the class and be able to make more connections and develop your own ideas. The grading is pretty vague, but seems to be mostly participation based along with three papers throughout the semester."

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

Though I wish I had taken it in the first semester of my Ph.D. I think having had the first year to understand the particularities and cadences of a doctoral program made taking it in my second year the best time to do it. Writing is Thinking has made me a better writer, reader, and confident person as it relates to both. Receiving weekly feedback on my writing helped me hone in on my personal writing skills and begin to figure out how to change/adjust them. More than that, this class forced me to confront my anxieties around writing and my fears of being seen as not being good enough. Though neither of those has ""gone away"" per se, I am now more able to sit with them and take more responsibility for how I sometimes allow them to overwhelm me. Toril seems intimidating, but she is so deeply kind. So kind. Receiving consistent feedback and engagement with your writing and thinking from someone so deeply invested in both is not something that happens even 2% of the time in graduate school. Most people never receive that, and the few who do receive it too late. The class might feel scary, but you will be deeply cared for while not being coddled, and you will grow a lot in the process"

reading and discussing: there are a lot of reading for this course compared to other courses. discussion also heavily relies on the things we read in class and each person's ability to engage in a conversation. I feel like the course is a really good exercise for me just because we are exposed to discussions all the time. 
Time management skill: because there are a lot of reading, it is up to the students themselves to organize the readings and find time to read them. The course has definitely prepared me for future readings."

I learned how to read critical readings. It was fairly difficult cause it was a different type of academic writing but it was very insightful. 
I learned better critical thinking skills and expanding on others' ideas."

Darren Gobert,4,What made this class stimulating or how could it be more intellectually stimulating if it wasn’t?,"Exploring the specific components of a script or production that made it work a certain way (e.g. representation in Fairview, amphitheater setup for the Bacchae) was intellectually stimulating.Suggestion for improvement: I would add discussion of more non-white and especially non-European theater -- or change the course description to clearly indicate that the course focuses on Europe/US.* Even a ""there is theater in the Global South too but we won't cover it here"" would have been good.*The course description advertised ""non-European and non-white perspectives,"" and while this was technically true, it was a bit disappointing to realize that the only non-European play was from the US."

It is a very new style of writing to me and at first I was quite unfamiliar with it, but after writing a couple of scenes, I've gotten the hang of it and learned how fun and flexible this writing style is. It is interesting since you have to also consider stage directions since ultimately you are writing for a play which will be acted on stage, so it is cool to think about how your story and play will appear on stage and think about what stage directions are the most effective to achieve your vision of the play."

If you enjoy theater and want to get more experience on the playwright side, take this class. If you have no experience in writing or theater and want a fun and rewarding creative outlet, take this class. Come to class ready to engage with your peers' scripts, but that may not even need to be said because everyone in the class was eager to read each others' scripts. The only possible reason I can fathom that someone wouldn't be satisfied with this class is if they didn't put in any effort; this was not the case of anyone I know who's taken it, but I suppose in the abstract it is theoretically possible. I would STILL encourage that person to take this class because even shy or ""too-cool-for-the-arts"" students will get a kick out of this class.

Making myself dive into writing for a new medium (as I had no previous experience with screenwriting) is what really started to give me a sense for what goes into a script.
Stay on top of your long script at the end, though. Checkpoints are built into the class, so don't get behind on them, because that 80 page script is very manageable if broken up over multiple weeks, but very scary if you've let it pile up!"
