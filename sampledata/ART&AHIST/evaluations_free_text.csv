Professor Galletti was always extremely clear and made the information really digestable without making it overly simplified or boring. I really enjoyed our coursework just being drawings instead of the more conventional writing tasks; it was an appropriate and really interesting way to learn about architecture and spaces.

Professor Galletti is an incredibly engaging lecturer and the class is extremely well organised and taught, beyond being just really interesting.

She also always answered questions really well. If she had an intro class on just art as well I would take it! Because of this class I am now taking another art history class next semester even though it is very unrelated to my main interests and major."
