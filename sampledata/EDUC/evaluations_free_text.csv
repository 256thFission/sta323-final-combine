It was a simple gesture, but it showed that she genuinely cared about how we were doing, both inside and outside of class. That kind of intentional care created a safe and welcoming space for learning.In terms of course components, I really liked the balance between the instructor’s presentations and the team presentations we gave as students.

To be specific: we learned about Marx's earlier ideas of humanism (alienation/estrangement, species-being, reification/fetishism) and how some Marxists viewed them (namely, Jameson's view on popular culture), about Marx's later ideas of historical materialism and his analyses of history (including Capital and the value it represents, primitive accumulation, class struggle, etc.) and how some Marxists view them (for example, Malm's Marxist Ecology and Fraser's take on Marxist Feminism), and ultimately how these two Marx-es (among some others) could serve as a window to a 'larger Marx' - representing the entirety of Marx and his philosophy."

The readings all felt relevant, if not a bit tedious to analyze, and a student's mileage may vary regarding their interest/engagement with the content."

However, I do wish we had more time to discuss the readings as it often felt like we did a lot of work on them outside of class and only got to talk about them for a brief period.

I wouldn't give up on being a writing consultant out of fear for the workload in WR 255. But know it is a lot of work (reading and writing), so don't expect it to be low commitment. I can also see how this course may be difficult or frustrating if you are not very liberal politically--just keep in mind going in, you may not buy into all of the ideas presented in this course. I do think the overall leaning of the course fits within a very specific ""university woke-ism"" that may not be palatable to some.

He organized the information clearly and concisely, providing access to all assigned readings, which facilitated our learning progress. This organized scheme enabled me to efficiently track my learning.He offered us the chance to create our own class structure. From the first day, he taught us how to develop our own teaching methods. Gradually, he relinquished his authority as a teacher, allowing us to become both students and teachers simultaneously. This experience taught me creativity and hopefulness.In this course, I learned to be socially aware and humane. David emphasized how dialogue is the cornerstone of human connection and growth. A key concept, the I-Thou method by Martin B., was central to the course. It involves understanding the navigation (words) between different universes (people's minds) and their collisions (dialogue). The course showed me that dialogue is about being sensitive to those around us, a process of discovering and creating with a person rather than labeling them."

This was a refreshing respite from the monotonous learn, study, test of a typical Duke course that made me genuinely excited to both show up for the class and do classwork outside of class. The anarchic structure of the class facilitated my learned because there was no preset content that restricted students from learning what they collectively felt was important. If an unforeseen topic arose, it was welcomed and explored rather than shut down due to divergence from a set plan. Overall, I would say I would keep the methods of instruction the same for future years. However, this is not possible because the structure lay within the body of students that comprises the class and the teacher that comes along with it. So, perhaps keeping the instructor is all that can be done to try and make a class as successful and engaging as The Dialogue Laboratory of Fall 2023."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The class's structure was broad and wide open to student interpretation. Dr. Landes created an environment in which we found consensus about our goals in the laboratory together and pursued them as a group of individuals always trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. The course's lack of pre-imposed structure was filled by a group dynamic where we'd explore the parts of dialogue we found most fascinating, which were often influenced by readings we'd do before class.There was a predefined structure to the extent that we'd come to class and converse with each other, share our thoughts and try to understand each other better. Also, Dr. Landes would step into the conversation and try to steer it to match group consensus and address runaway analysis among the group, bringing us back to the emotional basis of the conversation.Overall, the structure was ideal for this kind of laboratory. We'd read the background knowledge required to understand our own goals and to create a mutual understanding about the role of our laboratory in achieving them, and we'd structure class itself around those goals dynamically. This allowed us to pursue the ideas we found most interesting to a much greater depth, and allowed us to pursue our experimental aims free of restrictive class structure.I would keep the entire class structure into the future."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Our assignments employed a unique and effective method for teaching dialogue. After each class, we were tasked with creating three distinct reports: a reading reflection, a field report, and a laboratory report. This trilogy was fascinating, as each component required a different set of skills. Reading reflections improved our ability to recall and apply the most personally significant concepts from the readings. Field reports challenged us to apply classroom concepts in our daily lives. The laboratory reports, being the most crucial, helped us understand our individual and collective roles in the specific context and timeframe of each class. Essentially, we discussed the unique or local knowledge we created in our dialogue class.From this class, I learned that the most lasting concepts for the future include: ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"" which highlighted learning and teaching as transformational processes and critiqued the current educational system's dampening effect on our desire to transform the world; ""Creating Safe Spaces and Brave Spaces,"" emphasizing the importance of fostering transformation and hope for a better world; ""Thought Leaders in Dialogue Theory,"" demonstrating that the idea of transformational praxis is not only advocated by Davis but has been systematically studied; ""Kairos,"" stressing the importance of speaking at the right moment; ""Social Choreography,"" encouraging a unique perspective on social interactions through spatial organization and people's responses; and ""Semantic and Poetic Meaning,"" contrasting how semantic meaning often falls short in expressing complex emotions like love, whereas poetic meaning can capture these nuances."

Aside from readings, this class was entirely focused on the people in Social Sciences 109 from 3:05-5:35 every Tuesday. The in-class dialogue was always entertaining because students had the choice to stimulate themselves with whatever dialogue they saw fit for the moment (kairos). However, a lot of my intellectual stimulation actually came from the weekly assignments. It was in these assignments that I did the most self-discovering and produced mind-blowing realizations or connections from both inside and out of the classroom."

We created a group mind that truly tried, and often succeeded wildly, at understanding the feelings underlying our curiosity and addressing those points we were most interested in seeing addressed.These curiosities varied throughout the year, but letting dialogue succeed in bringing them forward meant that they were addressed to almost just the right depth and were constantly the focus of the class. So, for example, this class was intellectually stimulating in that it tested how language choices effected the way others responded to language, and also in how other dialogic choices such as body language tone and positional landmarks created different effects on dialogue. Whatever the specific hypotheses of the class demanded, we explored with one another. We got to see the effect of our interests in action, answering them more holistically. Finally, we refined the skills of approaching others and creating a group mind in action, which is something that can only be learned from experience.Its a very abstract course in some ways, but when the laboratory starts cooking it becomes very real and very personal in a matter of minutes. I think seeing how our abstractions related to real emotions was the most stimulating part of the course."

In every session, we were evaluated on a participation basis, which kept our brains active, encouraging us to think critically, openly, and humanely. I am considering taking this class again and feel that every professor should experience it too, as it fosters a sense of connection and applies the concept of 'scinus'—a genius arising from collective thought processes. This class has the potential to transform our rigid and erratic perceptions of growth. It encourages us to think collectively and individually, challenging the notion that society must be entirely individualistic."

This class focuses on learning how to brainstorm and create collaboratively. It's pointless if you only focus inward. Engage with ideas and concepts, and train yourself to understand the perspectives of those around you while exploring new ways of interacting with them. Most importantly, set your own expectations for your role in the course. It's a journey of personal exploration, so don't merely mimic others' behaviors. Instead, understand why they act as they do and how this understanding can enhance your interactions with them. Develop your own style; there's no right or wrong. Identify your objectives and be true to yourself."

Second, I discovered how a group of strangers sitting in a circle can create an entirely new ""collective consciousness"" through dialogue, where our shared understanding becomes deeper than any one person's individual thoughts. Finally, and most importantly, I learned that what seems like ""just talking"" is actually an incredibly complex dance of human connection, where every word, pause, and response shapes not only our conversation but who we become as people."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I learned to see conversations as a way to build meaning collaboratively, not just exchange ideas. I'm an international student, and taking this course with Prof. Landes has given me the language and toolbox to approach everyday conversations as fun toys rather than something we just ""do"". Notably, I don't think the course gave me ""new tools"" or ""tips and tricks"" for having conversation, but rather gave me (1) a space and a community to experiment with and get honest voices and advice about my communication, and (2) a language to explicate what might feel ""right"" or ""wrong"" within a conversation and what each action might contribute to a conversation.- I started recognizing that every interaction is shaped by interpretive lenses, helping me better analyze the dynamics at play. This idea was also formed in his past class (WRIT 101) and it plays hand-in-hand perfectly with this class. Two extremely impactful ideas that I continuously repeat to my friends that I've learned throughout my time learning with him were that (1) there is no such thing as an ""objective"" or ""true"" lens, and (2) particularities--not generalities--foster the relatability within a narrative/story. Definitely use the language we built in this class over interpretive lenses in my everyday life.- I realized the value of embracing ambiguity and using it to explore deeper, more nuanced perspectives rather than seeking immediate clarity. A lot of the people that come in are CS/Engineering majors that are very used to the dry-cut communication of numbers and fact (self-included). This course (and Prof. Landes' approach) give us a culture shock that ""useless"" conversations are where true humanity shows up and how people connect."

The weekly ""lab reports"" were genius because they forced me to process and analyze what happened in our discussions, helping me see patterns and dynamics I would have totally missed otherwise.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I've taken WRIT 101 and WRIT267S with Prof. Landes back-to-back. I've had a lot of conversations him inside and outside of the class, and he has definitely earned my full respect over the year or so that I've met him. It's the type of respect that comes when you know someone is *extremely* convinced and in love with what they do and put in the time to understand it and study it well. Once you speak to him and understand the context of his experience in the past, who he taught, his hobbies, you gain more and more of an appreciation to his relationship with the subject. You start to feel like it is his literal baby or ""magnum opus"". Regardless, Prof. Landes leads the class with the mentality of trying to simply enhance your growth, not particularly direct it. He gives advice and treats people as individuals with separate interests and personalities, which makes the class have a very amplified personality. Some of the advice, experiences, and lessons he has shared with me have even contributed to my personal life in an extremely concrete way. Conversations with him are dense with lessons that are applicable to the class and beyond.As for specific components of the course that stood out to me, the focus away from the usual educational banking model and letting the class direct the conversations of the day is definitely the star of the show for me. Prof. Landes is insanely good at letting conversations happen and only talking when he has to or when it adds to the conversation. I felt a real connection with the class for sure. There is a reason why I felt so strongly about taking this class after WRIT 101--similar feelings were felt in that course."

For starters, it held me accountable to finish deliverables for my thesis that had looser deadlines, which was very helpful.  Beyond that, I had fellow classmates stress a lot at the beginning of the thesis class because we were told to write a literature review without many of having learned what a literature review was, but this course had told me exactly what a literature review was and provided me with a myriad of best practices for writing one.  The readings are not too challenging but very rewarding, so do them all.  This class is well worth anyone's time and I expect to use what I learned in this class in job interviews and my future career."

It was one of the most helpful courses that I took at Duke. However, the class does require a lot of time commitment, averaging around eight hours of work per week. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are looking to improve your writing skills and learn how to write a good research paper. The amount of feedback you get on all your work will drastically improve your writing skills. Additionally, Dr. Asmuth is very clear with their expectations, meaning that it is possible to do well in the course if you put in the work. The grading criteria is detailed and you will not receive a bad score with no justifications.I would not recommend for you to take this course if you are looking for an easy writing credit."

I also feel very comfortable disagreeing with people and listening to different ideas and learning from my friends. My favorite thing is that the class is not traditionally structured with lectures and homework. We have a lot of time for discussion which is much needed especially in this chaotic senior year."

The professor encouraged us to share our thoughts even if they weren't well developed and didn't make the discussion participation necessary. By doing so, everyone spoke when they truly wanted to, which made the environment much more relaxed and opening. The class also did not have a big work load. It was mainly just readings and a few projects that were very introspective. The fact that the class was so low stress made it so much more enjoyable. I was genuinely excited every single Monday for class and it makes me super sad I won't have it at all anymore next semester."

Marx's theories of the world were already useful in understanding our modern world, but we also learned about what was different between now/then, and some places where Marx failed to see the entire picture. To be specific: we learned about Marx's earlier ideas of humanism (alienation/estrangement, species-being, reification/fetishism) and how some Marxists viewed them (namely, Jameson's view on popular culture), about Marx's later ideas of historical materialism and his analyses of history (including Capital and the value it represents, primitive accumulation, class struggle, etc.) and how some Marxists view them (for example, Malm's Marxist Ecology and Fraser's take on Marxist Feminism), and ultimately how these two Marx-es (among some others) could serve as a window to a 'larger Marx' - representing the entirety of Marx and his philosophy."

I wouldn't give up on being a writing consultant out of fear for the workload in WR 255. But know it is a lot of work (reading and writing), so don't expect it to be low commitment. I can also see how this course may be difficult or frustrating if you are not very liberal politically--just keep in mind going in, you may not buy into all of the ideas presented in this course. I do think the overall leaning of the course fits within a very specific ""university woke-ism"" that may not be palatable to some. But you are allowed to share different ideas as well as your reservations about the scholarship openly. And when it comes to your individual research paper, you can select the topic, so you can choose anything that interests you within the realm of writing center and literacy scholarship more broadly."

This organized scheme enabled me to efficiently track my learning.He offered us the chance to create our own class structure. From the first day, he taught us how to develop our own teaching methods. Gradually, he relinquished his authority as a teacher, allowing us to become both students and teachers simultaneously. This experience taught me creativity and hopefulness.In this course, I learned to be socially aware and humane. David emphasized how dialogue is the cornerstone of human connection and growth. A key concept, the I-Thou method by Martin B., was central to the course. It involves understanding the navigation (words) between different universes (people's minds) and their collisions (dialogue). The course showed me that dialogue is about being sensitive to those around us, a process of discovering and creating with a person rather than labeling them."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The instructor facilitated my learned by being very unconventional in his teaching style. This was a refreshing respite from the monotonous learn, study, test of a typical Duke course that made me genuinely excited to both show up for the class and do classwork outside of class. The anarchic structure of the class facilitated my learned because there was no preset content that restricted students from learning what they collectively felt was important. If an unforeseen topic arose, it was welcomed and explored rather than shut down due to divergence from a set plan. Overall, I would say I would keep the methods of instruction the same for future years. However, this is not possible because the structure lay within the body of students that comprises the class and the teacher that comes along with it. So, perhaps keeping the instructor is all that can be done to try and make a class as successful and engaging as The Dialogue Laboratory of Fall 2023."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The class's structure was broad and wide open to student interpretation. Dr. Landes created an environment in which we found consensus about our goals in the laboratory together and pursued them as a group of individuals always trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. The course's lack of pre-imposed structure was filled by a group dynamic where we'd explore the parts of dialogue we found most fascinating, which were often influenced by readings we'd do before class.There was a predefined structure to the extent that we'd come to class and converse with each other, share our thoughts and try to understand each other better. Also, Dr. Landes would step into the conversation and try to steer it to match group consensus and address runaway analysis among the group, bringing us back to the emotional basis of the conversation.Overall, the structure was ideal for this kind of laboratory. We'd read the background knowledge required to understand our own goals and to create a mutual understanding about the role of our laboratory in achieving them, and we'd structure class itself around those goals dynamically. This allowed us to pursue the ideas we found most interesting to a much greater depth, and allowed us to pursue our experimental aims free of restrictive class structure.I would keep the entire class structure into the future."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Our assignments employed a unique and effective method for teaching dialogue. After each class, we were tasked with creating three distinct reports: a reading reflection, a field report, and a laboratory report. This trilogy was fascinating, as each component required a different set of skills. Reading reflections improved our ability to recall and apply the most personally significant concepts from the readings. Field reports challenged us to apply classroom concepts in our daily lives. The laboratory reports, being the most crucial, helped us understand our individual and collective roles in the specific context and timeframe of each class. Essentially, we discussed the unique or local knowledge we created in our dialogue class.From this class, I learned that the most lasting concepts for the future include: ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"" which highlighted learning and teaching as transformational processes and critiqued the current educational system's dampening effect on our desire to transform the world; ""Creating Safe Spaces and Brave Spaces,"" emphasizing the importance of fostering transformation and hope for a better world; ""Thought Leaders in Dialogue Theory,"" demonstrating that the idea of transformational praxis is not only advocated by Davis but has been systematically studied; ""Kairos,"" stressing the importance of speaking at the right moment; ""Social Choreography,"" encouraging a unique perspective on social interactions through spatial organization and people's responses; and ""Semantic and Poetic Meaning,"" contrasting how semantic meaning often falls short in expressing complex emotions like love, whereas poetic meaning can capture these nuances."

Aside from readings, this class was entirely focused on the people in Social Sciences 109 from 3:05-5:35 every Tuesday. The in-class dialogue was always entertaining because students had the choice to stimulate themselves with whatever dialogue they saw fit for the moment (kairos). However, a lot of my intellectual stimulation actually came from the weekly assignments. It was in these assignments that I did the most self-discovering and produced mind-blowing realizations or connections from both inside and out of the classroom."

We created a group mind that truly tried, and often succeeded wildly, at understanding the feelings underlying our curiosity and addressing those points we were most interested in seeing addressed.These curiosities varied throughout the year, but letting dialogue succeed in bringing them forward meant that they were addressed to almost just the right depth and were constantly the focus of the class. So, for example, this class was intellectually stimulating in that it tested how language choices effected the way others responded to language, and also in how other dialogic choices such as body language tone and positional landmarks created different effects on dialogue. Whatever the specific hypotheses of the class demanded, we explored with one another. We got to see the effect of our interests in action, answering them more holistically. Finally, we refined the skills of approaching others and creating a group mind in action, which is something that can only be learned from experience.Its a very abstract course in some ways, but when the laboratory starts cooking it becomes very real and very personal in a matter of minutes. I think seeing how our abstractions related to real emotions was the most stimulating part of the course."

The most stimulating aspect for me was the ability to express identity using both an intellectual and humane component. In every session, we were evaluated on a participation basis, which kept our brains active, encouraging us to think critically, openly, and humanely. I am considering taking this class again and feel that every professor should experience it too, as it fosters a sense of connection and applies the concept of 'scinus'—a genius arising from collective thought processes. This class has the potential to transform our rigid and erratic perceptions of growth. It encourages us to think collectively and individually, challenging the notion that society must be entirely individualistic."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I learned to see conversations as a way to build meaning collaboratively, not just exchange ideas. I'm an international student, and taking this course with Prof. Landes has given me the language and toolbox to approach everyday conversations as fun toys rather than something we just ""do"". Notably, I don't think the course gave me ""new tools"" or ""tips and tricks"" for having conversation, but rather gave me (1) a space and a community to experiment with and get honest voices and advice about my communication, and (2) a language to explicate what might feel ""right"" or ""wrong"" within a conversation and what each action might contribute to a conversation.- I started recognizing that every interaction is shaped by interpretive lenses, helping me better analyze the dynamics at play. This idea was also formed in his past class (WRIT 101) and it plays hand-in-hand perfectly with this class. Two extremely impactful ideas that I continuously repeat to my friends that I've learned throughout my time learning with him were that (1) there is no such thing as an ""objective"" or ""true"" lens, and (2) particularities--not generalities--foster the relatability within a narrative/story. Definitely use the language we built in this class over interpretive lenses in my everyday life.- I realized the value of embracing ambiguity and using it to explore deeper, more nuanced perspectives rather than seeking immediate clarity. A lot of the people that come in are CS/Engineering majors that are very used to the dry-cut communication of numbers and fact (self-included). This course (and Prof. Landes' approach) give us a culture shock that ""useless"" conversations are where true humanity shows up and how people connect."

Landes was more like a skilled facilitator than a traditional instructor, guiding our discussions with light touches while letting us discover profound insights on our own. The weekly ""lab reports"" were genius because they forced me to process and analyze what happened in our discussions, helping me see patterns and dynamics I would have totally missed otherwise. I especially loved how responsive the course was to our group's specific needs - when we'd hit communication roadblocks or discover interesting tangents, the professor would adapt assignments and readings to help us explore those areas deeper, making everything feel incredibly relevant and personally meaningful."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I've taken WRIT 101 and WRIT267S with Prof. Landes back-to-back. I've had a lot of conversations him inside and outside of the class, and he has definitely earned my full respect over the year or so that I've met him. It's the type of respect that comes when you know someone is *extremely* convinced and in love with what they do and put in the time to understand it and study it well. Once you speak to him and understand the context of his experience in the past, who he taught, his hobbies, you gain more and more of an appreciation to his relationship with the subject. You start to feel like it is his literal baby or ""magnum opus"". Regardless, Prof. Landes leads the class with the mentality of trying to simply enhance your growth, not particularly direct it. He gives advice and treats people as individuals with separate interests and personalities, which makes the class have a very amplified personality. Some of the advice, experiences, and lessons he has shared with me have even contributed to my personal life in an extremely concrete way. Conversations with him are dense with lessons that are applicable to the class and beyond.As for specific components of the course that stood out to me, the focus away from the usual educational banking model and letting the class direct the conversations of the day is definitely the star of the show for me. Prof. Landes is insanely good at letting conversations happen and only talking when he has to or when it adds to the conversation. I felt a real connection with the class for sure. There is a reason why I felt so strongly about taking this class after WRIT 101--similar feelings were felt in that course."

Many other courses won't provide such a constructive and helpful process of writing a research paper.

Some specific components of the course that rocked: I really appreciate that at the beginning of the class, they went over examples of past homework responses and made it very clear what they were and weren’t looking for.  I also like that when they could tell folks were losing attention, they would discreetly call on us and ask a question to bring us back into focus."

For starters, it held me accountable to finish deliverables for my thesis that had looser deadlines, which was very helpful.  Beyond that, I had fellow classmates stress a lot at the beginning of the thesis class because we were told to write a literature review without many of having learned what a literature review was, but this course had told me exactly what a literature review was and provided me with a myriad of best practices for writing one.  The readings are not too challenging but very rewarding, so do them all.  This class is well worth anyone's time and I expect to use what I learned in this class in job interviews and my future career."

It was one of the most helpful courses that I took at Duke. However, the class does require a lot of time commitment, averaging around eight hours of work per week. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are looking to improve your writing skills and learn how to write a good research paper. The amount of feedback you get on all your work will drastically improve your writing skills. Additionally, Dr. Asmuth is very clear with their expectations, meaning that it is possible to do well in the course if you put in the work. The grading criteria is detailed and you will not receive a bad score with no justifications.I would not recommend for you to take this course if you are looking for an easy writing credit."
