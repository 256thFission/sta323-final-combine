Lectures are very challenging if you have a weaker statistical foundation; preview lecture notes if possible and seek out additional resources online before lectures to get the most out of the classes and to be able to engage fully. Review lecture notes after lectures every week, as it's very easy to get behind in this class.Don't be afraid to ask questions, and don't feel discouraged if others seem to ""get"" the content faster than you do, since MESS is highly competitive and has some of the smartest people at Duke. Would especially recommend taking this class if you're not a prospective stats major, as it might change your mind and get you interested."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I was able to appreciate Statistics in a new lense. I didn't really consider all the new and intricate ways there are of modeling and I thought that was cool. I also enjoyed how broad the subjects of the course were. There were weeks where we went deep into complex mathematics and then weeks where we looked at networks of high school hook-up culture. In terms of more concrete things we learned it was 1. A significant step forward in the stats one learned in AP stats. 2. It was my first class where the HW assingments were substantially harder than the tests, It's important to collaborate with others on those. 3. Make sure to go to office hours."
