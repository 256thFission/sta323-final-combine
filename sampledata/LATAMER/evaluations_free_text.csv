Please describe three specific things you learned.",I gained significant knowledge about prison life and systems throughout the world. Alongside this came a lot of insightful thinking in cases where I had to look deep into literary texts to find true meanings or hidden symbolism that the author was trying to convey. The final major thing I learned has to be the method of conversation that surrounded in class discussions we had about different topics. These were especially interesting to me because sometimes there was no right answer. You had to be respectful of everyone's opinions and still voice yours with certainty.

I gained an idea of what prison conditions are really like and how they compare to prisons in other countries around the world. I also acquired the skill of strategically reading a long academic article and picking out what is important as opposed to reading the entire thing closely. Lastly, I developed more of a capacity to humanize those that tend to be demonized or looked down upon in our society."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","We had a few readings due each class that kept us stimulated in this field of study even on days when we did not meet. Some of the tougher readings felt very long and slow to read, but the more personal accounts that lay on the more extreme ends of what we were studying were very enjoyable to read and often stayed in my mind for quite a while. I would keep the in-class documentaries and demonstrations we watched (like the different prison clothes we explored on the website). These broke up the monotony of just reading and talking about it and let people reset their brains to then have another discussion after it ends. Many of them were also very enjoyable too."

During class, I liked open discussion times where peers and I could chime in to discuss answers to difficult questions. Small groups were okay too. It was helpful for homework readings to be explained during class.
I really enjoyed your rational approach to different perspectives and your forgiving/non-punitive attitude as an instructor. It contributed very positively to the class environment."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",I thought that the general discussion-centric environment (especially the small group discussions) facilitated my learning about the topics of the class. I also very much appreciated the scaffolding of the final paper; it allowed me to not procrastinate the paper and deeply consider my writing over a longer period of time. The activities where we were put in the place of prisoners were also very eye opening and allowed me to truly envision what these people have to go through. I would keep all of those aspects of the course in future years.
