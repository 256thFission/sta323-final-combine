Please describe three specific things you learned.","While taking the course, I learned that I am a very visual learner. I need to draw diagrams on my notebook to fully understand what I am covering. I also learned to look through the transcript of the videos in case I missed info while taking notes. Another method I used when studying was to look at the bigger picture. Since this class covers many small steps and sections of body systems, it was easy to get overwelmed. Taking a step back to look at the bigger picture helped me understand the function of the topic I was covering."
