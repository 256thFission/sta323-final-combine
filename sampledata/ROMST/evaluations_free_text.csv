You don't need any prior knowledge of the topic to take the course. The professor is really nice and class is generally pretty engaging. The class is quite a lot of work, and it certainly isn't easy. You need to do a lot of reading and write a weekly discussion post on the reading, and you have a couple big papers which are tough. But, the professor does provide you with lots of help and resources for those, so the work is manageable for the most part. Overall, I highly recommend this class."

This course has helped my thinking of connected histories and the ways in which we read/write/do history. The contexts that gave birth to Columbus have been very eye-opening and give solid grounds to how a character, as emblematic (in its many definitions) as Columbus, came to be and evolve into what it did. My thinking is certainly more robust when considering Columbus and his contemporaries."

I loved studying these historic texts and secondary sources with students outside of my own program, which allowed for new insights and understandings that have shaped the way I approach work in my home discipline. Dr. Martin created a lot of pathways for us to engage with the material, and I appreciated the weekly message board assignment as it allowed for me to engage my classmates and begin a dialogue even before I entered the classroom. This was especially meaningful for a weekly seminar where I only see my classmates once a week, and want to make the most of the time together. Dr. Martin did a great job lightly facilitating the class, but otherwise emphasizing a student-led discussion of the materials. He never discouraged us from pressing a topic or conversation further, even if it didn't directly address the overall seminar topic, and these conversations always ended up being very rich and linking us back to the ideas and concerns that make us interested in studying Columbus in the first place."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I love the way the course was structured, both the overarching structure of different themes for different groups of stories and the day-to-day structure of reading 1-5 short stories for class, coming to class to discuss in-depth, and then writing a short paper about a handful of these stories later on. I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently.

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class.

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

By the end of the course, you'll be able to say that you're well-versed in modern European short fiction authors like Kafka, Joyce, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Mann, Sartre, Camus, etc. You get to do some cool out-of-class excursions too, like to the Rare Books library and the Nasher. The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently. I genuinely have no criticisms of this class."

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class. Take this course esepcially if you want to read more and read these types of texts and engage with them in a relaxed and growth-centered manner but dont have the time in your personal life or other classes to do so.

This course has helped my thinking of connected histories and the ways in which we read/write/do history. The contexts that gave birth to Columbus have been very eye-opening and give solid grounds to how a character, as emblematic (in its many definitions) as Columbus, came to be and evolve into what it did. My thinking is certainly more robust when considering Columbus and his contemporaries."

I loved studying these historic texts and secondary sources with students outside of my own program, which allowed for new insights and understandings that have shaped the way I approach work in my home discipline. Dr. Martin created a lot of pathways for us to engage with the material, and I appreciated the weekly message board assignment as it allowed for me to engage my classmates and begin a dialogue even before I entered the classroom. This was especially meaningful for a weekly seminar where I only see my classmates once a week, and want to make the most of the time together. Dr. Martin did a great job lightly facilitating the class, but otherwise emphasizing a student-led discussion of the materials. He never discouraged us from pressing a topic or conversation further, even if it didn't directly address the overall seminar topic, and these conversations always ended up being very rich and linking us back to the ideas and concerns that make us interested in studying Columbus in the first place."
