I learned about reaction rates and how they are influenced by factors like temperature, concentration, and catalysts, and how to apply the rate laws to predict reaction behavior. In thermodynamics, I gained an understanding of concepts like enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy, which allowed me to analyze and predict the spontaneity of chemical reactions. Additionally, I strengthened my knowledge of atomic chemistry, including atomic structure, electron configurations, and periodic trends, which helped me understand chemical bonding and reactivity."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","One thing I learned in taking this course is the importance of rechecking one's work even if one is certain with their answer. Chemistry is very memorization and mathematics based meaning that it is inevitable that one may make a mistake. In units such as thermodynamics and integrated rate law/kinetics, the majority of our homework assignments were math based where we had to make conversions using stoichiometry or integrate algebra to find the quantity of a substance. In all, it is noted that chemistry is very tedious which made me become a much more meticulous student who ensured all her units, conversions, and math were done precisely. Another thing that I learned while taking this course is how there's a lot of intersectionality of different material into different courses. Again, chemistry is very math based which led to the usage for algebra and physics to complete assignments or understand new topics. It's fascinating to know that other subjects can be applied to subjects I learn, enhancing the level of interest I have for the subjects. Lastly, I learned the importance of working together. During the discussions, it was mandatory that we talk amongst our teammates to finish our assignments. In doing so, I was able to see my mistakes and correct them through the help of my group member."

She writes her notes on the board but doesn’t explain how to apply them to specific questions. She mostly covers the basics and expects students to figure out how to use that knowledge on their own. We rarely did practice problems in class, though she started incorporating them during the last unit, which I appreciated. I found the discussion sessions much more helpful because they taught me more than the lectures. Many of the problems in discussion covered material we hadn’t learned yet, so my TA played a significant role in helping me understand those concepts. I would say that Professor Martinez focused on teaching the most basic concepts, which wasn’t very helpful for the tests.

While our lectures were held in the early morning, she always showed excitement in presenting new topics to us. This made me feel motivating in understanding the topics as the level of passion she displayed for each topic seemed genuine. Furthermore, what I liked most about Professor Anna Martinez is that after finishing a problem on the board, she would look immediately look around the room to see if there were any questions from the students. If a student had a question, she was always eager to answer their question, never making students feel uncomfortable in asking for help.

I understand it's very hard to get 200+ students to engage in a lecture, and in a sense, the drive to engage must come from within, but there are strategies to grab people's attention: hooks, fun games, calling on people to answer questions, telling a personal story, etc. I feel like implementing some of these strategies more in future semesters would make the class more stimulating."

If you have not taken AP Chemistry, then you will STRUGGLE in this class. I would recommend you take Chem 99. I wish I would've taken Chem 99 because I just had one semester of my small town high school chemistry class sophomore year (and my school did not offer AP chem). Going into this class, it was expected that you knew the content. Everyone in this class was at very different levels, most of which all had taken AP chem. Even the kids who did take AP chem struggled a lot. Beware, you will be expected to know a lot of background knowledge for this class. If you have not taken AP Chem, take Chem 99. Chem 101 was not an introductory course at all!!! The first exam was insane, it was nothing like the practice we did in class, but it the exams got better as the semester went on."

He seems to be the one who creates most of the test, and his section focuses on solving practice problems and explaining how to tackle more difficult questions that prepare you for the test. While Professor Martinez’s class may seem easier during the semester, it doesn’t provide enough preparation for the test, making it feel much harder than it should be. The course material in this class wasn’t overly difficult, but the lack of preparation for the tests made it challenging. The practice tests provided by Professor Martinez are much easier than the actual test and shouldn’t be relied on to gauge how prepared you are. This disconnect made it harder to feel confident and ready for the real exams."

The exams are entirely based on questions like that of the discussion problems and practice problems on Canvas. With this, the best way to achieve a passing grade on an exam is to attempt those practice problems as those are the types of questions going to be asked on the exam. Adding on, going to office hours helps in understanding problems one may not understand, especially office hours done by the professors themselves. The TAs and professors do a marvelous job explaining the practice problems. On one occasion, I went to office hours done by Professor Cox. After office hours, I left feeling enlightened and confident in performing well on my exam. This goes to show that taking advantage of everything provided by the course instructors or helpers prepares you to do well in the class in general. Furthermore, I would highly recommend attending all the lectures. While it is no brainer that students should be regularly attending lecture, the early lectures often discourage students to not attend. Each lecture is absolutely helpful to understanding the unit's content."

Additionally, if you want to know relatively how you are doing you will need to make a spreadsheet that calculates it--which I recommend because it helps motivate you and track your progress--since they utilizes Canvas' built in grade calculations. For the professors, I would recommend organizing everything on Canvas so students can see what is due and how they are performing in the class. Grades are very important to keep current because that tells students what they need to work on and how well they are doing."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Cox: The learning environment of the class was really good. Cox did a good job at commanding the class and engaging everyone, and I think his slideshows also helped create a good learning environment because they were easy to comprehend and were always relevant to what he was talking about.I really liked the aktiv homework assignments because they were also great practice with both concepts and application but they were never stressful because you had multiple chances to get the answer correct and you would also be provided feedback on why your answer was wrong so that you can learn and fix it. I think that the discussion was a useful component of the course that helped facilitate learning because it allowed me to apply what I learned in lecture that week to practice problems. It also gave me a chance to ask the TA's questions as I worked through the problems. Contrarily, the labs did not help facilitate my learning because they were never related to the topics we were learning in lecture."

Also, there are so many different places that things are assigned, it is a good idea to keep a separate calendar with all your due dates because they do not tell you on Canvas when things are due and its very hard to remember everything. Additionally, if you want to know relatively how you are doing you will need to make a spreadsheet that calculates it--which I recommend because it helps motivate you and track your progress--since they utilizes Canvas' built in grade calculations. For the professors, I would recommend organizing everything on Canvas so students can see what is due and how they are performing in the class. Grades are very important to keep current because that tells students what they need to work on and how well they are doing."

We developed the skills of recognizing the difference between this two theories being that the molecular theory is more complex, not being a great fit for larger and complex molecules, yet it working great to look at molecules such as water into a deeper level because it might show some aspects the atomic orbital theory does not show because of its simplicity.
2. Another method developed was thermodynamics. Specifically, we learned about entropy, enthalpy, free energy, and how they interact and impact each other in a molecule. Free energy combines enthalpy and entropy into a single value by using and equation.
3. A last insight we develop was acid, base reactions and chemical equilibrium. I now know weak acids and bases are lower in energy than strong acids and bases, and because equilibrium favors the reaction side with the lowest-energy species, acid-base reactions will go to the side with the weakest acids and bases. The equilibrium of a reaction then favors the side with weaker acids and bases."

He made sure to let us know that he had individual meeting sessions available if any student needed it. Another helpful method of the courses that was very helpful was the discussion sets. Discussion sets had a purpose of putting in practice everything we had learned on that week, and they were very similar problems to the ones given on the tests. It was a great aspect because difficult problems on the tests were not a surprise because we had the opportunity of working with them before hand."

Often half the class was asleep because it was just the professor talking the whole time. There was also very little interaction between the professor and the students in the class because of the large amount of students int he class. I would advise having more sections with less people. Additionally in a lecture this big, I would expect Parise to wear a mic, because in the back of the lecture hall it is extremely hard to hear, I have especially heard this from people who have hearing disabilities but also people with normal hearing. 
It would also be helpful for Parise to record lectures and post the lecture recordings and notes, because when you're sick it's extremely difficult to know what happened in class. IN class I'm very focused on trying to jot down all the notes rather than understanding what is being said. If notes are posted I can focus on understanding in lecture and then taking notes afterwards to cement the information in my brain."

I think he would be an amazing professor for a higher-level Organic Chemistry course. He is extremely knowledgeable in much higher levels of Chemistry and sometimes wants to impart that knowledge onto his 101 class, but the difficult part is that we are not ready for it being new students to the subject and being in an introductory course. It is definitely possible to do well in this class, but it requires lots of time in addition to class devoted to learning concepts since they the way they are explained makes it very difficult to understand for the first time in lecture."

While I applaud the incredible work of the TAs to fill in the gaps in teaching and caring, this course instruction was well below my expectations. The professors exhibited an overwhelming lack of empathy and care for students, instead opting to increase workload and shame those struggling. I am particularly disappointed in their reaction to most students struggling on Exam 1, which initially had an average score in the low 50s. Rather than recognizing that group failure likely indicated poor teaching on their part, they chose to complain that we all weren't trying hard enough. They offered for us to take the exact same test with the exact same resources a second time, which would be an almost comedic example of trying the same thing and expecting different results if it weren't extremely disheartening and frustrating. This isn't how you teach. Clearly we were not properly prepared."

While I applaud the incredible work of the TAs to fill in the gaps in teaching and caring, this course instruction was well below my expectations. The professors exhibited an overwhelming lack of empathy and care for students, instead opting to increase workload and shame those struggling. I am particularly disappointed in their reaction to most students struggling on Exam 1, which initially had an average score in the low 50s. Rather than recognizing that group failure likely indicated poor teaching on their part, they chose to complain that we all weren't trying hard enough. They offered for us to take the exact same test with the exact same resources a second time, which would be an almost comedic example of trying the same thing and expecting different results if it weren't extremely disheartening and frustrating. This isn't how you teach. Clearly we were not properly prepared."

As this course included but also built on previous knowledge, it provided a necessity to consult previous tactics and knowledge that I had used in AP chemistry. Another thing that I learned or developed in this course was a deeper focus on the calculation aspect of chemistry. Noticeably, while the content and the knowledge was important, the application of the knowledge created better chances to practice calculations for chemistry. Finally, a third thing that I learned throughout this course was how to study outside of classes and adapt to the teacher's method of testing. Throughout going through multiple quizzes and exams, noticeably the best way to succeed was to continue practicing problems supplied in the textbook."

He is a phenomenal explainer of organic chemistry because he is able to simplify complex concepts so that they are understandable. He is also extremely knowledgable and can explain a single concept in multiple ways-- this is crucial in orgo because sometimes a single explanation does not suffice. Multiple explanation includes hand signs, molecular modeling kits, the whiteboard, and the ipad.  He was also very personable which made the entire class highly engaged. All of the content in the class was taught in class. This was not the case in chem 101 where learning was done through a reverse classroom model which was highly ineffective towards understanding. Dr. Gooden focused heavily on understanding these concepts so that they are replicable on exam questions. The provided lecture notes, practice problem sets and practice exams directly reflected what the exams looked like-- there were no surprises on the exam. This gave me confidence during exams.

Gooden also made expectations very clear as to what would be expected out of us on exams. His notes were always in depth and had written explanations. These were not always gone over (for obvious time restraints), but they were there for supplemental information after lecture. In addition to all of this, Gooden provided a very very substantial amount of practice problems through his discussions, problem sets, practice exams, and in-class examples. For each exam I redid every single thing he gave me and I felt extremely prepared because of it.

I think that it would have been more stimulating if there had been more use of the molecular modeling kit or time to try out practice problems in class (I understand that's the purpose of the discussion session, but we cover many more things in class than discussion's 10 questions a week could keep up with, leaving some things without a lot of time to critically process)."

The lectures are only helpful if you have read the material before coming to class, otherwise, they are pointless to attend. The practice tests are essential to doing good in class, so use them wisely and don't waste them. Lectures are also helpful for the occasional practice questions.

Second, reviewing the content before each lecture is really necessary. Personally, I crammed to review the reactions before the third midterm and it was both time-consuming and difficult to memorize all of them within a couple of days. Finally, pre-read the textbook before each lecture can help you make use of lecture time because the professor will skip many ""not important"" topics to save time to cover more content. However, some of the topics that are not fully elaborate in lecture are useful when learning new concepts in the future."

It is expected that you review over the materials while having a 50% comprehension before coming to class, where you get your understanding slowly reinforced. I highly recommend making the most use of your time in office hours and get all of your questions answered as soon as possible. Also take advantage of discussion time. Going over the problem set is also extremely helpful with enhancing understanding.

That way, when you inevitably have trouble on a topic, you can ask it in class when she's actually teaching it. Class feels like it's meant to be a check to see if you're understanding things, and to get familiar with her style of questions and perspective of organic chemistry.

If you show up to lecture without having read the textbook, it will more than likely be less helpful than not even showing up to class. Professor Wang is very kind and wants you to succeed, but you have to go into the class knowing that you are reading over 600 textbook pages and practicing for hours outside of lecture in order to succeed."

Even after reading the reviews, I convinced myself that it couldn't possibly be as difficult as everyone was saying it was, but they were right. Dr. Wang doesn't have empathy for students that perform poorly on her exams, and she makes you feel bad about not understanding a topic right away. If you want to or have to take organic chemistry with Prof Wang, be prepared."

She is always willing to answer questions, and she responds to emails quickly. However, I would strongly advise against taking this course unless the rest of your courseload is relatively light. This course is the most difficult class that I have ever taken, and you will need to dedicate the majority of your time to it to avoid falling behind. There is so much content that it is impossible to cover all of it during lecture, so you will need to dedicate time to studying information both before and after lectures. Additionally, the labs can be relatively time consuming, so you will need to set aside time to complete those as well."

I learned so much about how different compounds/molecules interact with one another in a reaction form a whole new product. In a way, this class was like cooking but with organic molecules as the ingredients. One thing I learned is the naming of different organic molecules, which is a useful skill to have as it allows me to identify almost any compound I see based on just its structure. Another thing I learned is reactions between organic molecules. There is basically an infinite number of reactions that can take place, whether it be addition, radical, substitution, or elimination. Finally, I learned about stereochemistry which really allowed me to think about chemistry form a 3D point of view. The way molecules orient themselves in space are essential to understanding how they interact and how they are related to one another."

3. One of the most important lessons I took away from this course was the value of staying on top of the content. Everything builds on one another, and making sure I consistently practiced really helped solidify my understanding. That’s such a valuable lesson that I’ll carry with me in future courses."

She recognizes if the class is shaky on a topic, and she will go back and make sure we understand it. I really recommend this class!"

If you are committed to doing the practice problems he assigns and dedicate time to deeply understanding problems, the tests will not be hard. Thus, I would say the content of Orgo1 is not that challenging; it is more that you have to dedicate a lot of time for practice in order to succeed. Don't let the premed fearmongering scare you!

Parise makes learning and taking notes reasonable but you still need to spend hours every week doing practice problems to actually remember how to perform reactions. I didn't find going to the lecture reviews particularly helpful, but using them as practice problems was super beneficial so it is a really good thing that he puts the answers up. Going to lectures is a must though they are repetitive and a bit slow, especially if you read the textbook sections before coming."

It's really amazing to have a group thats all taking the same class, but also eating meals together, going to the beach, holding study groups, etc. We all supported each other through the class, and I was never stuck doing work feeling like I had nobody to ask for help. The marine lab really builds a community that translates so well into academic support. It really felt like everyone around me wanted me to learn and to help me to learn. Because Professor Canelas was our professor, discussion TA, lab TA, and grading TA, all in one, she knew exactly where we were at and how to help us. Being in such a small class compared to main campus, Professor Canelas could actually take the time to go back and reemphasize topics we were struggling on, answer specific questions, and work with us, rather than constantly needing to stick to a rigid schedule, hoping we keep up. Professor Canelas also held review sessions before tests/quizzes on Sunday nights that were so helpful (especially for calming nerves!)"

It’s very easy to just not follow the schedule so don’t fall into the trap.

It’s a hard class but you don’t have to balance other classes with it, and I found that the condensed schedule made it easier to learn since I can have a hard time retaining things over longer periods of time during fall/spring semesters.

This allows them to have more time to learn the initial information and have any questions they may have answered during actual lecture. This way, the new information is also reinforced throughout lecture since it is the second explanation of it you  see."

The instructor is funny and keeps you engaged. It was such a small class that it was very easy to ask questions and often the instructor was willing to alter structure of a lecture based on what students asked for.

Don't forget that this is something you're choosing to spend your summer doing, and while it's okay that you may ""dread"" it, it can be (or just is) an enjoyable and intellectually stimulating course! 
- take advantage of the facilities and natural environment around you to spend any free time you have 
- practice, practice, practice! Sometimes, it can be difficult to understand WHY something works (highly recommend OrganoMech for that), but being able to familiarise yourself with the mechanism of a reaction and what happens often leads you to better answer questions you previously had"

I was initially scared to take Orgo because everyone says it is a super hard course but Professor Canelas made it extremely manageable, fun, engaging, and really made me feel like I learned and absorbed a lot. The course was perfectly paced and through frequent practice problems built into the course, I was continually challenging myself to understand the material instead of passively learning. Professor Canelas does everything she can to help you learn and is super understanding and open to helping you.

Taking orgo in a block schedule format allows you the time to really understand the content without being overwhelmed by other classes. Despite being only 6 weeks, the class doesn't feel rushed at all and you definitely aren't overwhelmed by class time (3-4 hours a day but its very well split up with breaks and only a 4 day week.) Professor Canelas really emphasized that she wanted us to get the full experience of spending the summer at the marine lab, encouraging us to take breaks, go to the beach, watch dolphins, etc. and that really helped us all to not get burnt out. Orgo is hyped up to be a really hard class, and it is, but this format makes it super manageable."

We do practice worksheets in discussion, and these worksheets gradually teach you the steps of the problems which I found nice. I think it was important to understand every step so that it was a lot easier when you had to use all of them in one problem at the end. I also think that this discussion was helpful for understanding that helping other people understand the material was very useful for your own understanding. Although it is the summer, and fewer people would show up to discussion, I think that when I was explaining things to people in my groups, it helped me a lot in my own understanding of the material."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I liked everything about the structure of this class. The lecture on Monday of strict information and then 2 other days of working through problems with peers allowed me to essentially get a one-on-one tutor feel during class time which helped to learn material much faster. This class sets you up amazingly for success and dependent on how much work you put in, you can succeed. I actually had a good amount of chemistry experience in high school but felt unsure of how well I would do in a chem course in college, so I last minute decided to take 99D instead of 101 and am so glad I did. I probably could have done okay in 101 going straight in because I had chem experience in high school, and I still struggled to relearn basic concepts that all my teachers always assumed we knew but were never formally taught. It is so nice for Dr. Canelas and Anna to go fully in depth in explaining basic concepts that are never really taught in detail, at least in my experience, and they never make you feel stupid for asking ""easy"" to answer questions and in fact encourage more questions. I have talked to so many students in this class that had barely any chem experience in hs and are extremely grateful for having this opportunity to learn they didn't have in hs."
