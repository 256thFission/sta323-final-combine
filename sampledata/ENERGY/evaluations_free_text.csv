I never really understood why the U.S was so intertwined middle east and this class has taught me to think critically about energy and how it affects markets.The professor is very heavy on student presentations in the second half of the semester. I found this to be very useful as it helped me understand and poke at presentations and not take everything for a fact. He made us write a paper about another students presentation and what they could have improved upon.

In core econ classes, we see how supply and demand and competitive equilibrium work, but I enjoyed applying those frameworks to coal production models and OPEC and thinking about how to world actually operates.

Also, the class structure is purely dependent on PowerPoint lectures, which can be monotonous. However, it is a really good class if you're interested in learning the science, physics, and math behind energy generation and different forms of energy. All in all, I think the class had great potential but just needed more interaction. Lastly, the class itself is not super hard, but it's important to pay close attention to lectures for the test."

I think everything we learned is important to know and valuable information-- especially if you're going into energy or environment or policy related fields. The class is mostly lecture-based with some readings. There are exams, but no final. The first exam is a bit difficult, but once you understand where the professor is coming from, they're very manageable. The professor also clearly cares about his students and loves the topic"

It helps put into perspective why nations choose certain fuels over others."

I feel I have a strong background in the basics of economics (Econ 101) from my undergrad. It seems my classmates that did not take the econ 101 prereq seriously struggled. I think this prereq should be more firmly enforced at the Nicholas School to aid in student success in this course.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","After the first class, prompted by others in the class, I went up to Prof Wedding (Chris) and asked him what I should do about my pending job deadline/decision. I made a pros and cons list following his advice, and this helped orient my thinking / make more peace with the choice I was mostly likely going to make anyway. The rest of the classes and content flowed well following this, as it was helpful to hear about others' career progressions and interests – no path is ever linear, and choosing one thing does not set you down one forever. I really liked that the class pushed me out of my comfort zone, as Chris is engaging as a speaker and attentive as a professor (encouraging those to speak up, giving constructive feedback on slide decks, etc.). He organizes the 2.5 hour classes as a combination of lectures, activities, discussions, and speakers, leaving you no space to feel lost or bored (or if so, easily recoverable)."

Really strong practitioner and experience, very engaging lectures and class discussions.  But, Chris is clear that he doesn't care about grades versus what you learn.  So if you care about your marks (or simply take pride in your work and engagement), consider who the TA(s) are during Drop/Add and how well you trust their feedback as actually being representative. Know that it is very possible to both get really strong/positive feedback from Chris on an assignment or presentation that is worth 20% of your grade, and then receive one of the lowest grades in the class for the very same assignment."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The instructor and course structure were extremely engaging. Dr. Wedding is an outstanding teacher -- he was approachable, relatable, and extremely interesting. The format of the course, which combined lectures and ample venture capital and founder speakers, allowed me to both learn about climate tech startups and VC and see applications in the real world. Through conversations with different guest speakers, I gained an understanding of the unique perspectives, challenges, and goals of climate tech professionals. In future years, I would keep the combination of guest speakers and lectures. I appreciated the Canvas resources and professional development primers. As an undergraduate student, I felt like I learned a lot from the questions and experiences of the graduate students in the class. Finally, I found the readings and assignments extremely relevant, current and informative without being overwhelming or feeling like busy work."

The exam format being short answers and multiple choice (literally choose more than one thing) forces me to understand the material instead of basing things on pure guesses if it is multiple choice (single choice). I don't think Dr. Pratson is a terrible lecturer, but he is not a very kind person. After the first exam he basically shamed the entire class for doing poorly by comparing us to the mechanical engineer Duke undergrads. He also straight up told us he doesn't like to hand out good grades and there would not be practice exams or redos later in the semester. It's almost like he does not want us to succeed in this course. I got very high scores on both the exams so far so I don't have too big of an issue with how he teaches, but I don't like his attitude when he addresses his students."

Course content is useful if you want to dive deeper into certain markets, but the course leaves you to do a lot of research on your own, you will not necessarily get insights about the climate tech market from the instructors, you will get guidance on how to explore those markets."

I specifically want to highlight that she reserved a classroom with a whiteboard for her meetings which helped students visualize segments of the homework problems. I wish the other TAs had also reserved classrooms. Jaimie also added select 1-1 office hours that I found helpful.

For the future, I think the two books (Rhodes and Scott) are very essential to the course and should be kept. They were both engaging and clear in explaining the history of energy. The keywords were also important components of the course that I believe should be kept. They allowed me to better remember and make sense of what I read.

Also, the class structure is purely dependent on PowerPoint lectures, which can be monotonous. However, it is a really good class if you're interested in learning the science, physics, and math behind energy generation and different forms of energy. All in all, I think the class had great potential but just needed more interaction. Lastly, the class itself is not super hard, but it's important to pay close attention to lectures for the test."

The exam format being short answers and multiple choice (literally choose more than one thing) forces me to understand the material instead of basing things on pure guesses if it is multiple choice (single choice). I don't think Dr. Pratson is a terrible lecturer, but he is not a very kind person. After the first exam he basically shamed the entire class for doing poorly by comparing us to the mechanical engineer Duke undergrads. He also straight up told us he doesn't like to hand out good grades and there would not be practice exams or redos later in the semester. It's almost like he does not want us to succeed in this course. I got very high scores on both the exams so far so I don't have too big of an issue with how he teaches, but I don't like his attitude when he addresses his students."

The professor is not for you, and you should consider how many other required courses and electives you have to take for the BE concentration. Maybe consider switching to EEP or EAM so you have fewer required courses that are not up your alley."

Lastly, in working with a team and taking on the unofficial role of the project manager, I learned more about how to motivate team members, and where I need to provide a little push where needed vs. when to step back and let other people do the work on their own terms, even if I might do it a bit differently myself."

I think that some more activities around applying these concepts, or more detailed lessons could have been helpful. Alternatively, perhaps a short reading could be provided prior to lessons so that the class could all get to at least a baseline understanding prior to the class discussions. This could be more helpful for people who were less familiar, and could then allow for a richer discussion for people who were already familiar and wanted to try to take their learning and application to the next level.As noted above, I also think it would have been more interesting and helpful to meet the founders at the beginning of the course as well, and give us more context and more to think about/ consider throughout the term, reducing the time of the learning curve, and allowing for more time for critical thinking and analysis."
