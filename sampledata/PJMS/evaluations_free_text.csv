We learned about the technical aspects including information to include but also artistic aspects about how to best recreate a point in time. 
2. We learned about different structures of long form journalism. We learned how to weave information between scenes to create a full picture of an issue and its underlying events. 
3. We read many long form articles and discusses how the authors' choices contributed to the emotional impact, clarity, and flow."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This class was a stellar deep dive into skills I thought I had already acquired. This is a class for beginner writers of many kinds, but especially the writer who has never dealt with creative ways of expressing ideas. I learned so much about how to write beautifully, how to tell someone's story in a way that does them justice, and how to phrase ideas in unique ways. On top of beautiful writing skills, I learned a lot about how to critique and take criticism. Barry effectively sets an example for how to break down works, both iconic and beginner pieces, and understand their structure, their qualities, and potential improvements. Additionally, we learned how to investigate. I believe this is applicative to many classes. Research is a term broadly used in descriptions for investigative pieces, but Barry emphasizes that research comes in many forms. I loved this class and I can confidently say I have learned the most in this once-a-week seminar compared to any other class at Duke."

That has changed throughout the course of the semester with Stephen's salient advice to go into every story with a question, and has changed my modus operandi to focus on questions now instead of answers. I also learned the value of grace and understanding and what he calls the ""gift of high expectations,"" and after a difficult semester where personal time was few and far between and I was stretched incredibly thin, Stephen's counsel and understanding were both instrumental.

I learned how to frame questions to extract the most vivid detail from an interviewee by asking them of specific details of their experience, rather than probing them to repeat details I may have already heard about the scene itself.
3) I also learned how ethics in the newsroom is a highly debated topic and how it is often a gray area that operates on a case by case basis."

He has high standards and expects a lot from you but is not harsh about it, and does whatever he can to help you succeed rather than batter you down when you're struggling. He's also incredibly honest and forthright, but always expresses himself gently — that makes learning from him easy, and immensely valuable.As for course structure, there isn't much I would change. The assignments are varied and thought-provoking and spaced out well throughout the semester. The one suggestion I'd have is to maybe have slightly clearer assignment directions in the syllabus itself, beyond word count. For instance, for our final project the direction in class was to write a ""reported profile about yourself,"" and having that in writing I think may be good."

2) I gained insight into how the current culture and environment of the journalism landscape incentivizes some journalists to plagiarize or fabricate facts in their stories, like Stephen Glass.
3) I'm now able to better emphasize in what way the journalist of an article is biased—and I can also avow that all journalists and people are biased in some way. For example, you can be biased towards the truth."

Not only did we hear from journalists and journalist experts, but we also heard from students like us who have ventured into journalism and encountered its problems from a fresh perspective. We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning.

2) I learned to think and write like a journalist (Dr. Sullivan especially, being a pro-journalist, imparted so much wisdom to us) — I learned about effective, clear, and engaging information delivery, and how to critically analyze sources for relevancy.
3) A specific 'piece' of knowledge that was super thought-provoking for me was the existence of the press as business entities as well, and how much attracting audiences and generating profits that way influenced the inner workings of the press. Applying that to real life was even more eye-opening — the paywalls blocking access to the New York Times and the Washington Post, for example, are an example of business models that work... But is this at the cost of information access (leading to a more informed populace)? This class really helped me ponder questions like this."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","1) I really liked how discussion-oriented our class was — we were provided with a guiding question each lesson, and it was so interesting exploring various facets of the topic and then delving into further 'branches' of discussion based on interesting observations and points of analysis that my classmates made.
2) Our guest speakers were amazing, and I learned so much from listening to them and asking them questions. Len Downie, who was a key figure in the Washington Post's reporting surrounding the Watergate Scandal, for example, spoke to us, and it was so eye-opening hearing about his first-hand experience — it really brought what we learned to life! (IT'D BE SO COOL TO KEEP BRINGING IN AWESOME GUEST SPEAKERS — EXPERTS IN THE JOURNALISM FIELD — FOR FUTURE STUDENTS & FUTURE CLASSES!)
3) By extension, the syllabus was also super clear — readings for each class (accompanied by our guiding discussion question) were laid out since the beginning of the semester, as were our deadlines. This helped me prepare for our class discussions and helped me contextualize the readings and identify key points.
4) I also liked how the class only happened once a week (but for a long time — 2 hours & 30 minutes) — this meant that the class was more low-stress & manageable, which helped with my learning since I had more time to properly digest the material we'd discuss.
5) Our instructors also created an awesome learning environment — they were super casual, which made me feel a lot more comfortable and confident expressing my views!"

Before coming to Duke, I was aware that polarization was a huge issue, but this class provided so much context as to why this was the case.
2) This class made me think about how to be a better journalist (in practice) and brought issues and debates at the forefront of the journalism industry right into our classroom.
3) The course content also helped me consider my own experience with democracy and journalism in my home country, where democracy is eroding — I loved how applicable the course content was!"

It may be a lot of work at times but it so rewarding because the discussions and conversations are super interesting and relevant and really force you to critically think about the world around you. I would honestly take this class a second time if I had room in my schedule.
