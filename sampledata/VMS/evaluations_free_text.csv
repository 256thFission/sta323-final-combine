I learned to critically evaluate the use of racial categories in genomic studies and how they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes rather than address health disparities. The course also emphasized the importance of open communication and respectful discussion, allowing me to listen to and consider different perspectives with an open mind. Additionally, I gained insights into how race intersects with other identities, such as gender and socioeconomic status, to shape health outcomes, reinforcing the need for culturally competent care. These lessons have fostered a socially conscious and ethical approach to addressing systemic inequities in science and healthcare."

It hardly ever met, there were no opportunities to test our knowledge, and there were no assignments besides the final. The professor didn't use slides or organize his lectures beyond a basic chronology from the beginning of hip-hop to the present day. Because the professor cancelled so many classes, we never made it close to the present day and finished in the 1990s. There are podcasts about hip-hop that have to be better than this. Really disappointing and a waste of a credit."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","A course that encompasses a breadth of material to critically interrogate what constitutes ""story"" and to whom. I learned about Eastern vs. Western storytelling modalities and the role of Orientalism in framing narratives in faraway lands through our unit on A Thousand and One Nights, as well as questioning if it is possible, in the guise of the modern novel with its emphasis on human consumption and emotion, to tell a story with a non-human subject by exploring the place of Sun Wu Kong in the Chinese literary canon. Turning our attention to familiar European storytelling traditions, we also studied the morphology of fairytales, as explicated by Vladimir Propp, and the socio-psychological imperatives baked into the archetypes of ""fairy stories,"" as posited by Tolkien. We likewise explored the ways the framework of game changes narratives structures by imposing ludology, rather than temporality, to guide stories."

I immensely enjoyed lecture and the various scratchpad exercises (tell a story in 6 words, craft a mystery, map archetypes to a fairytale, ""Are all stories bound up in power, property, and domination?"" etc). done with my peers. These encouraged us to debate the elements of story and form our own opinions on how we form and digest narratives.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",The environment of the class was extremely disengaged. Learning was not strongly facilitated as we were not given any material to learn. Assignments were poorly explained and felt as though they did not improve my learning as we were not building off any skills discussed in class.

To make the class even more intellectually stimulating, it could be helpful to look at a broader range of real-world experimental interfaces together as a class. While we were encouraged to explore, some of the presentations—both mine and others—started to feel a bit repetitive and leaned heavily toward apps and consumer products. It would’ve been exciting to get more exposure to how different interface concepts are being applied in fields like art, tech, and research. Professor Seaman was also knowledgeable & knew a lot of different interfaces/works/research relevant to our presentation/project topics off the top of his head; it might have been more engaging to learn directly from some examples/insights alongside student presentations."

I would propose that students work towards making an actual website at the end of the project instead of making a slideshow presentation as we did not implement any skills of interface design. This class is more accurately described as a discussion class since there was a lack of knowledge being applied. Each week’s class was the same with presentations taking the entire period, so I would get rid of these a commit to having an open discussion about specific principles and techniques each class to add direction."

It was a collaborative environment that facilitated learning and I often left class feeling inspired to write. I wouldn't change anything about the class."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was a great introduction into understanding film on a more technical level! We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

Third, I learned a conceptual framework from academic film reviews that can provide a deeper perspective for interpreting films related to environmental issues, such as global waste, mining industries, toxicity, manufactured landscape, and multispecies entanglement."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. I learned how different groups of people embrace eco-media as an approach to environmental criticism. Most importantly, I learned how varied directors portrayed manifestations of environmental degradation differently to approach the questions concerning agency and subalternity. 
2. I learned methods of analyzing not only eco-media works but also its materiality. Specifically, I learned about how they are produced, circulated and consumed. More importantly, I learned how the production and circulation of media could impose secondary toxic effects on the environment.
3. The course content also helps me to learn to situate and historicize different forms of precarity regarding one's embeddedness within global capitalism."

I've learnt to be more analytical in my interaction with documentaries as an audience member. I've learnt to not just share initial thoughts but deeply analyse editing techniques, politics, specific frames and angles and how all these come together to tell a compelling story.2. I've learnt to appreciate writing more. We did a lot of writing in this class, from reflections accompanying the different Engage and Mini-Engage assignments and the many free-writes we did in class. It's brought back a lesson I learnt from my old writing teaching: ""writing is thinking"". I've done a lot of thinking through writing in this class, more than any other class I've taken this semester.3. I've gotten better at intimate interviews, audio documentation and editing and even video documentation and editing. One thing I enjoyed about the class was the Engage Assignments. They made the theory we were learning in class more practical. I'm far from an expert, but this class has provided a strong foundation!"

I definitely hated classifying these texts to the gothic/horror because it felt so unnatural and pointless to me (like why do we care if this text could be said to fit into the gothic/horror space, I would rather just talk about the text itself).

2) Close Reading and Film Analysis: I improved my ability to engage in close reading and film analysis, emphasizing how to critically unpack texts and visual narratives in relation to broader social and cultural contexts.

However, I learnt that often in academia, one has to bite the bullet and decide what battles to fight. As such I learnt to disengage from arguments that did not give me back fruitful ideas and were unproductive to thinking critically about the issues the artists' work that was the primary material in the course was trying to do. The actual work was often buried in the discussions about the artists themselves and the participants were not asked to refrain from make universal statements about the literary or film-studies based values expressed in the works. I learnt that when the discussion becomes performative, I must quietly save my labor for when I have the intellectual and emotional energy. I enjoyed quite a few of the readings, both primary and secondary, but found that the discussions were often overshadowed by manspreading in the workplace, an issue often unaddressed in the graduate seminar, a workspace often disguised as solely a classroom. Lastly, and on a positive note, I learnt how to identify textual evidence to dialectically decipher the place a given text occupies in the literary history as visible from the contemporary moment."

The syllabus could have included foundational texts like Susan Sontag’s ""On Photography"" and ""Looking at War,"" which were mentioned in class but not assigned. These could have enriched our discussions."

However, it could have been more intellectually stimulating with a stronger theoretical foundation and more guided analysis. Incorporating close readings of the texts, deeper engagement with key concepts, and connecting these ideas more explicitly to the films would have enhanced the intellectual depth. Additionally, balancing open discussions with structured input from the instructor could make the class more engaging and thought-provoking. One area for improvement would be including more trigger warnings and regularly checking in on students' mental health, as the nature of the films often addressed challenging and sensitive topics."

I would have loved to see more decolonial thought on humanism as an exclusionary method to control humans and their poetic abilities as a member of the planet on a continuum with other forms of life and the material world that sustains them, rather than the notion of humans as elevated beings in control over the material reality upon which they are parasitic. far from being nihilistic, this poetic idea of a human as creative and trangressive rather than ascriptive and normative could have been the impetus for more stimulating and self-degrandizing set of discussions rather than 'redemption' as the limit of thought in the secularized versions of a Euro-Christian humanism."

The class follows a logical and suitable pathway starting from archival theories, to case studies, then to practicum classes. The ways that Hannah uses seminar, discussion sessions, and in-class check-ins with students have also been extremely helpful for everyone's growth in the class. I would definitely keep the same structure going forward, the structure of starting with theories before going to practicum classes. There should be more classes at Duke like the one that Hannah is teaching. This class teaches something that a traditional data science or statistics class wouldn't teach."

The professor clearly has deep knowledge of the subject, but I often felt there were limited opportunities to learn directly from his expertise. The course leaned heavily on student presentations, which at times led to uneven coverage of the material. Based on my experience in other seminars, dividing class time more evenly—half instructor-led and half student-led—has proven to be a more effective and enriching structure. This approach provides a stronger foundation for discussion and fosters a more consistent and engaging learning experience."

I felt that sometimes the actual classes felt dry since there was not an expectation to participate in class discussions. Often times the class stayed silent or surface-level when asked questions related to the readings or films. I feel that either making the class entirely lecture-based or cultivating an environment that inspires participation would enhance intellectual simulation.

We watched movies but were sent away with scripts to read and write over the week. This allowed for true digestion of the course material. We were able to zoom in if sick.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",I think the method of reading everybody's work in a roundtable is very effective for this class. It allows the class to remain true to how screenplays are read and understood in the film industry but it also really allowed me to get an understanding of what was effective and what wasn't in a way that I didn't really get from just reading the work on the page. I also really liked that we got to stick with one idea for the majority of the semester. I don't often get to do that in other classes and it really allowed me to dive deep into a plot line and into the characters I was writing. I'm really proud of the final product.

I've learnt to not just share initial thoughts but deeply analyse editing techniques, politics, specific frames and angles and how all these come together to tell a compelling story.2. I've learnt to appreciate writing more. We did a lot of writing in this class, from reflections accompanying the different Engage and Mini-Engage assignments and the many free-writes we did in class. It's brought back a lesson I learnt from my old writing teaching: ""writing is thinking"". I've done a lot of thinking through writing in this class, more than any other class I've taken this semester.3. I've gotten better at intimate interviews, audio documentation and editing and even video documentation and editing. One thing I enjoyed about the class was the Engage Assignments. They made the theory we were learning in class more practical. I'm far from an expert, but this class has provided a strong foundation!"

I would keep this in-class activities for future years, since they make class more interactive and I learn a lot from them. Katie, German, Chris, and Xueyan were all very passionate about their work and loved sharing it with the class. Their passion was inspiring and has encouraged me to continue pursuing documentary/cinematic arts."

To make the class even more intellectually stimulating, it could be helpful to look at a broader range of real-world experimental interfaces together as a class. While we were encouraged to explore, some of the presentations—both mine and others—started to feel a bit repetitive and leaned heavily toward apps and consumer products. It would’ve been exciting to get more exposure to how different interface concepts are being applied in fields like art, tech, and research. Professor Seaman was also knowledgeable & knew a lot of different interfaces/works/research relevant to our presentation/project topics off the top of his head; it might have been more engaging to learn directly from some examples/insights alongside student presentations."

I would propose that students work towards making an actual website at the end of the project instead of making a slideshow presentation as we did not implement any skills of interface design. This class is more accurately described as a discussion class since there was a lack of knowledge being applied.

However, if you are a photographer, I think that it is a great class for learning ""how to be a better photographer"" by considering all angles of the truth. Additionally, this class is a great class for getting introduced to photographic research as well."

I would highly recommend keeping all of the content that is used and learned in this class, as I feel it exposed me to a variety of concepts. Moreover, I think the structure and schedule of the readings was very well done, because I felt like I was directly putting the concepts I learned in reading into practice through actual videography."

I learned a lot from watching films in class and when we would have brief editing workshops. I wish there was a lecture component to the class rather than learning mostly from readings. The professor seems very knowledgeable and I would learn better from him. I would rather watch the films on my own then have a formal lecture/discussion for half the class."

Also expect to push yourself out of your comfort zone especially if you aren't very experienced with filmmaking. The final project in this class is a full short film, so if you are new to filmmaking and want to learn how to begin as a filmmaker, I suggest taking a lower level class."

I will not say the class is hard, but animation at its core is taking or creating dozens if not hundreds of pictures, which takes time.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In Dr. Charmaine Royal's Race, Genomics, and Society course, I developed a deeper understanding of how race, though a social construct, significantly impacts scientific research and healthcare. I learned to critically evaluate the use of racial categories in genomic studies and how they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes rather than address health disparities. The course also emphasized the importance of open communication and respectful discussion, allowing me to listen to and consider different perspectives with an open mind. Additionally, I gained insights into how race intersects with other identities, such as gender and socioeconomic status, to shape health outcomes, reinforcing the need for culturally competent care. These lessons have fostered a socially conscious and ethical approach to addressing systemic inequities in science and healthcare."

We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

Before, I knew film theory only from bits and pieces that I had read (out of context) in other courses, but this course really helped to frame and contextualize theory as a whole. I most enjoyed the semiotics unit and how investigating cinema as a language influenced more modern theorists in thinking about the socio-political impacts of film."

I felt that sometimes the actual classes felt dry since there was not an expectation to participate in class discussions. Often times the class stayed silent or surface-level when asked questions related to the readings or films. I feel that either making the class entirely lecture-based or cultivating an environment that inspires participation would enhance intellectual simulation.

Ninth Wonder cancels class constantly, and there are no assignments until the final paper and project. If you're looking for an easy A or just want to hear Ninth Wonder talk about the industry, you might enjoy this class. But if you're looking for any form of structured classroom learning this course is not for you."

The professor didn't use slides or organize his lectures beyond a basic chronology from the beginning of hip-hop to the present day. Because the professor cancelled so many classes, we never made it close to the present day and finished in the 1990s. There are podcasts about hip-hop that have to be better than this.

The instructor used an ungrading policy that while vague, asked students to work based on their own intrinsic interests and motivations. I think the readings should be kept as they were very helpful in gaining a broad understanding of disability as a study, discourse, history, and lived experience.

Turning our attention to familiar European storytelling traditions, we also studied the morphology of fairytales, as explicated by Vladimir Propp, and the socio-psychological imperatives baked into the archetypes of ""fairy stories,"" as posited by Tolkien.

It allows the class to remain true to how screenplays are read and understood in the film industry but it also really allowed me to get an understanding of what was effective and what wasn't in a way that I didn't really get from just reading the work on the page. I also really liked that we got to stick with one idea for the majority of the semester. I don't often get to do that in other classes and it really allowed me to dive deep into a plot line and into the characters I was writing. I'm really proud of the final product.

I commonly found myself presenting on topics that I found interesting, and both the professor and my colleagues would recommend me new topics to explore. The course also gives the students a lot of freedom in the topics they explore, so I was able to learn a lot of knowledge around topics that I wouldn't think of researching myself, but find interesting as they pertain to the body as an electrochemical computer. The three things I learned then are the ability to make connections between topics, the importance of ethics in artificial intelligence, and being able to think of humans from an artificial intelligence's point of view."

1) Exploration of Austrian Postwar Literature and Film: I gained a deep understanding of four major Austrian writers and filmmakers—Thomas Bernhard, Elfriede Jelinek, Michael Haneke, and Ulrich Seidl—whose works are foundational to postwar cultural and literary criticism in Austria.
2) Close Reading and Film Analysis: I improved my ability to engage in close reading and film analysis, emphasizing how to critically unpack texts and visual narratives in relation to broader social and cultural contexts.
3) Understanding Representations of Violence: I explored how graphic depictions of violence can serve as tools for education and enlightenment, pushing myself to remain open-minded about the purpose and impact of such representations."

However, I learnt that often in academia, one has to bite the bullet and decide what battles to fight. As such I learnt to disengage from arguments that did not give me back fruitful ideas and were unproductive to thinking critically about the issues the artists' work that was the primary material in the course was trying to do. The actual work was often buried in the discussions about the artists themselves and the participants were not asked to refrain from make universal statements about the literary or film-studies based values expressed in the works. I learnt that when the discussion becomes performative, I must quietly save my labor for when I have the intellectual and emotional energy. I enjoyed quite a few of the readings, both primary and secondary, but found that the discussions were often overshadowed by manspreading in the workplace, an issue often unaddressed in the graduate seminar, a workspace often disguised as solely a classroom. Lastly, and on a positive note, I learnt how to identify textual evidence to dialectically decipher the place a given text occupies in the literary history as visible from the contemporary moment."
