Though all the lecturers are excited about explaining their science, a subset of them are better scientists than lecturers. It would be best if the lecturers were made aware or were provided with guidelines stating that their lecture should cover the broad strokes of their field like fundamental principles and techniques, not so much about the details of their particular projects in the lab since that won't make it as broadly applicable to students in the class.

He has a problem-solving session and a Q&A session. Even if you don't have questions initially, it's beneficial to go to the Q&A session to hear what your peers are confused about or need clarifying because it can clear up confusion you may not realize you have or solidify the concepts in your mind. These are also both good for practicing new problems (another thing I recommend for other students... do as many practice problems as you can/need to feel confident in the material). There is a lot of material in 202, so memorizing will be hard; you should understand why the reactions are occurring so that you can apply that knowledge to novel situations."

You need to remember the reagents for synthesis and roadmap problems where you predict the products of different reactions. I would make a quizlet of all the reactions/reagents and start memorizing these ASAP! Do the practice problems, specifically office hours and discussion. Many of the test/quiz questions came directly from office hours or were variants of these problems. The past exams are also good practice. Dr. Cox's textbook (OrganoMech) is also good for breaking down each topic and he also provides practice problems at the end of each chapter, which are of course helpful because he writes them himself. Dr. Cox emphasizes that the purpose of his exams are to evaluate our ability to recognize patterns so I guess you should try to be good at that. More specifically, looking for connections between the steps of reaction mechanisms, the different pathways you can use to produce a desired product, etc. Also pay attention in lecture -- Dr. Cox isn't a professor who tends to go off on tangents and ramble about random things. Everything he says is usually pretty important and if he hyperfixates on certain reactions or compounds, you will undoubtedly see it on an assessment."

The best thing to do is use as many resources as possible outside of lecture, whether it's extra practice problems, office hours, or discussion section, these are all super helpful! It's kind of like learning a new language, you just have to keep practicing, keep getting things wrong, and keeping learning from your mistakes. Eventually, you'll build some intuition and start noticing patterns in questions. Also, definitely work together with your peers when studying or completing the Aktiv homework, it makes it a lot less scary to know other people have similar questions and confusions as you."

I would not recommend taking multiple hard STEM courses on top of this one. Not particularly more challenging than Chem 101 or Chem 201. From Chem 101 to Chem 201 to Chem 202 the courses become progressively less conceptual and more memorization-based. Which can be good or bad.

And it requires a lot of discipline to stay on top of the content and consistently work problems, since there is no homework and discussion is optional/not graded. It's very easy to fall behind and try to cram everything in the few days before the exam, which does not work. Your grade is also 100% exam-based. So don't take this class alongside other challenging courses like physics. Also, come to class because lecture is not recorded and no lecture notes are posted.

Try to stay on top of the material as much as you can, and do practice every day (especially if taking in summer). Just try your best and don’t get discouraged.

There is simply too much information to process in such a short duration of time even if you have the luxury of focusing solely on this course. You will be better off taking this class during the semester and doing your best to pair it with some less difficult classes. I was told that this course was more manageable during the summer, but I strongly disagree with that statement. No matter when you end up taking CHEM 202, I strongly encourage you to ask questions about things you don't understand. Information online will not always align with the preferences of your professor, so I generally think it is best to directly ask your professor about anything you have quesitons about. Dedicate time to studying the information you learn in class, and treat this course with the respect it deserves. It's known as a difficult class for a reason!"

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I think this course helped me understand that the only real way to prepare for a test is through practice problems. That was something that was emphasized daily, and I tried to do as many practice problems as I could which was very helpful. I think that usually I am a reader and I will read the entire chapter before doing any practice, but I did not do that in this course and it actually worked out better for  me than in other classes. Since this class took place over the summer and was very rapid, I also think that it taught me a little bit of time management and daily scheduling. I started making a schedule right before I went to bed for the next day which became very helpful. With that, a big thing that was also mentioned daily was the fact that we needed to take breaks. I think that I learned in this class that when you take breaks and give yourself time off you really are more relaxed for when you start studying again and it is very refreshing to just let your self calm down and take an hour or even day for your own mental health."

She was very encouraging and always reassured the class that the material is hard, but if we just learned the mindset of solving the problems we would be able to do them.

You need to be confident because this course will take all your confidence away. I can confidently say it was one of the worst courses I have ever taken and would never recommend this amount of physical and mental damage/stress to anyone. Get an external tutor if you have the money for it because Dr. Cox is a poor professor. Take care of your physical health while taking this course because I was under so much stress that my physical well being started to deteriorate. I was seeing signs of major stress with my hair falling out, loss of appetite, fatigue, mental fogginess, lack of confidence, etc. Personally, I would not recommend this course to anyone. It's not worth how much of myself I had to give. I put so much effort into this class and got absolutely nothing out of it besides poor grades and a horrible mental and physical wellbeing."

I say this because Dr.Cox is truly the most caring, impactful, and brilliant professor I have ever had at Duke. His love for teaching and his care for students' learning and growth truly shows every single day. Dr.Cox is always willing to spend additional time to help enhance student learning. Over this past semester, there were several instances where I emailed Dr.Cox about scheduling meetings with him to discuss course material/study strategies and he would always make time to meet with me and help clarify any concepts. I absolutely enjoyed this course — and I am grateful to have had Dr.Cox as my professor. My passion for chemistry and particularly, organic chemistry has only increased after taking this course.

There is a reason the Parise section had 50+ people on the waitlist and Widenhoefer had extra space. When one of the exam averages was 64% and he said that was right where we should be, because a 70% average would be too high, that said everything. If a professor feels that a 64% average in a class mostly full of dedicated premeds is acceptable, they should rethink their teaching style. It's a shame most chem classes are taught so poorly at Duke. It's an incredible subject but the teaching style is really ruining most people's experience with chemistry, especially Orgo."

The averages on tests are 65% and this curves to a B or B- depending on the semester.  To get an A, you need to be at least 1 Standard Deviation above the average.  However, on the exams, since a couple students get 100s while a couple score in the 20s and 30s, the SDs are absolutely absurd.  The standard deviation is generally ~20% or more.  This means that to get an A, you need to be at least 20% above the class average on all exams.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","My professor had these two discussion sheets. And this review applies only to these two specific sheets. One was the nuclear decay and another had to do redox (cells). These sheets are AMAZING. I can not stress how helpful they are. They walked me through the basics of concepts and allow places to workout the problems. As you go down the pages it becomes harder but at a good rate. I really do wish my professor had more sheets like this for every single discussion. Yes, we can ask our TA for clarifications, but when we finish the sheet on our time, the explanations and examples provided on the worksheet are so helpful. I would like to say that if these sheets were offered for every topic it would be a huge help. I think I learned so much from those sheets alone and could actually learn those concepts. Our professor would sometimes introduce themes through discussion before lecture, and doing through these specific worksheets is actually very helpful and impactful. I did not feel as overwhelmed as with other discussion sheets. Yes, individuals may argue that the beginning is very simple, but we still have to stress that not all students come from the same educational backgrounds. Yes we may have all taken 101 here at Duke, but that doesn't mean we are all on the same starting page. Not all the things learned in 101 can help you prepare for 201. Some students come from high schools in where AP chemistry was offered, and some students come from backgrounds in where little to no AP classes were offered. But what I really liked about these specific two worksheets, is that it just starts from the basics. No matter what your chemistry background is, it is important to start with the basics. And it is not that it even takes a lot of time to do, it just introduces you to the concepts in the beginning for you to make sure you understand. Yes, one can argue that the concepts can be explained in lecture, but that does not matter when you are currently in discussion. IN discussion, not in lecture. You can ask the TA for help, but when it turns out to be a simple concept that was not worth waiting for 10 minutes while the TA is answering other individuals questions, then it could have simply been explained in the worksheet. It is also stressful, since without these simple concept explanations and examples on the worksheets, how can discussion even be held with other students? Not everyone is on the same page in this situations, and one can argue that another student who understands a concept, can explain to another student instead of the TA (if TA is busy), but that should not be the student's job, especially in a limited 50 minute space. Which is why I really recommend to have those types of worksheets for every discussion, they are essential, and you can never go wrong with starting with the basics."

I felt like I was engaged by the interesting slides and stories that Prof C would tell. however, sometimes I did feel like we went on too many tangents and it would take away from the focus on the material. Then, I felt like there would be some gaps when I went to study for the exam. 
I thought the supplementary videos at the beginning of the year were very stimulating. It might be beneficial to have these alongside lecture for students studying for the exams."

And this review applies only to these two specific sheets. One was the nuclear decay and another had to do redox (cells). These sheets are AMAZING. I can not stress how helpful they are. They walked me through the basics of concepts and allow places to workout the problems. As you go down the pages it becomes harder but at a good rate. I really do wish my professor had more sheets like this for every single discussion. Yes, we can ask our TA for clarifications, but when we finish the sheet on our time, the explanations and examples provided on the worksheet are so helpful. I would like to say that if these sheets were offered for every topic it would be a huge help. I think I learned so much from those sheets alone and could actually learn those concepts. Our professor would sometimes introduce themes through discussion before lecture, and doing through these specific worksheets is actually very helpful and impactful. I did not feel as overwhelmed as with other discussion sheets. Yes, individuals may argue that the beginning is very simple, but we still have to stress that not all students come from the same educational backgrounds. Yes we may have all taken 101 here at Duke, but that doesn't mean we are all on the same starting page. Not all the things learned in 101 can help you prepare for 201. Some students come from high schools in where AP chemistry was offered, and some students come from backgrounds in where little to no AP classes were offered. But what I really liked about these specific two worksheets, is that it just starts from the basics. No matter what your chemistry background is, it is important to start with the basics. And it is not that it even takes a lot of time to do, it just introduces you to the concepts in the beginning for you to make sure you understand. Yes, one can argue that the concepts can be explained in lecture, but that does not matter when you are currently in discussion. IN discussion, not in lecture. You can ask the TA for help, but when it turns out to be a simple concept that was not worth waiting for 10 minutes while the TA is answering other individuals questions, then it could have simply been explained in the worksheet. It is also stressful, since without these simple concept explanations and examples on the worksheets, how can discussion even be held with other students? Not everyone is on the same page in this situations, and one can argue that another student who understands a concept, can explain to another student instead of the TA (if TA is busy), but that should not be the student's job, especially in a limited 50 minute space. Which is why I really recommend to have those types of worksheets for every discussion, they are essential, and you can never go wrong with starting with the basics."

For instance, I was never extremely comfortable in organic chemistry, and so having to relearn types of isomers and types of isomerism different types of coordination compounds can exhibit was a personal challenge. This class was also intellectually stimulating because it pushed us to solve difficult problems that required some critical thinking to approach. For instance, acid/base buffer problems require analyzing if an acid or base is being added, the effect on the reaction, creating an ICE table, etc."

However, I would also say that if you are a slower test taker like myself, this course will have exams that will have you rushed for time. Although the exams are fair, you definitely cannot rely on solely lectures to support you through this course. Sometimes the lectures can be a bit disorganized (ie: We spend the majority of class on a different topic/practice problem, leaving several slides we did not cover, which results in you having to go back after class and do the problems from the slides on your own). Additionally, I do like how she will tell stories which breaks up the lecture, making it a more engaging lecture, especially for a chemistry class. I did feel overall due to class timing issues we did not get to certain key topics and hope that that can be improved upon in the future."

If you're not prepared to get 40s and 50s on exams, then you may need to consider finding another teacher. Lectures are going to feel like what you learn is anecdotal and the actual math you learn for the exams is going to be based in what you do in the homework and discussions. You will need to be studying THE ENTIRE WEEK leading up to any midterm (more, if you can) and even then, you won't get above a 70% on a test (60% if you're really lucky) and you're just going to have to learn be okay with that. The practice problems that you see outside of Zumdahl (the textbook) probably won't be the level of difficulty you see on the test and by that I mean the test will be much harder. I feel like he takes pride in knowing that he teaches a difficult subject, in the sense that he really should be teaching this at a graduate level but refuses to convey information in a more palatable way to undergraduates. He doesn't attempt to correct the fact that students are scoring so low on exams (failing, mainly). I've spoken to other students who have taken this class and said that this subject has been taught much more simply in the past by other teachers, in a way that students both understand the subject and score well on exams, so I know it is possible. I would even say I learned more from Dr. Martinez (the person who lead our discussions) than I ever did from Warren, and even then she (with her Phd) admitted she had difficulty explaining some of the course content that he was teaching. I urge you, if you value your GPA, take this class elsewhere or with another teacher.Additionally, I would just like to note that Warren joked about not being able to be fired via our comments, which may be true, but something about that statement being said so casually has some truth to it. He casually recognized that we have reason to say that he should be removed from teaching the class. This is not difficulty for the sake of deeper learning and thought, this is difficulty because cannot (or refuses to) stoop down to an undergraduate teaching level."

He talks a lot about chemistry but that's not teaching, he shows his slides and says this is why this works then continues moving on to another topic but then when it comes time for the exam it doesn't feel as if you're prepared by going to lectures. I will say that when he does example problems in class or goes over previous exam questions that he sometimes puts in his slides, this is the most important part of the lecture and is the only thing that'll actually help you learn.He's incredibly smart so he does know how to explain practice problems or other questions well.

You will need to be studying THE ENTIRE WEEK leading up to any midterm (more, if you can) and even then, you won't get above a 70% on a test (60% if you're really lucky) and you're just going to have to learn be okay with that. The practice problems that you see outside of Zumdahl (the textbook) probably won't be the level of difficulty you see on the test and by that I mean the test will be much harder. I feel like he takes pride in knowing that he teaches a difficult subject, in the sense that he really should be teaching this at a graduate level but refuses to convey information in a more palatable way to undergraduates. He doesn't attempt to correct the fact that students are scoring so low on exams (failing, mainly). I've spoken to other students who have taken this class and said that this subject has been taught much more simply in the past by other teachers, in a way that students both understand the subject and score well on exams, so I know it is possible. I would even say I learned more from Dr. Martinez (the person who lead our discussions) than I ever did from Warren, and even then she (with her Phd) admitted she had difficulty explaining some of the course content that he was teaching. I urge you, if you value your GPA, take this class elsewhere or with another teacher.Additionally, I would just like to note that Warren joked about not being able to be fired via our comments, which may be true, but something about that statement being said so casually has some truth to it. He casually recognized that we have reason to say that he should be removed from teaching the class. This is not difficulty for the sake of deeper learning and thought, this is difficulty because cannot (or refuses to) stoop down to an undergraduate teaching level."

I have never had a professor who so clearly did not prepare for his lectures and it seemed clear that he did not care very much about the material he attempted to present. Only about 20 students showed up to lecture which is the worst attendance I have ever witnessed in a Duke course. I learned almost exclusively from the TA in this course.

While exams were not difficult, I was very disappointed in the instruction I received in this course, and ended up learning most content from the textbook, the TAs, and the other professor's PowerPoints. Lectures consisted mostly of working problems from the textbook, which not only made it such that you only learned how to solve computational problems rather than learning the actual theory behind concepts, but were often riddled with errors. Despite the fact that all problems demonstrated in lecture were directly from the book (which has a key), Dr. Wiley often made conceptual and computational mistakes and had clearly not taken the time beforehand to look over his own notes, both of which actively hindered the learning environment. Slides that didn't come directly from Dr. Canelas were clearly made by ChatGPT, which speaks for itself. I STRONGLY recommend that the Chemistry department consider assigning another instructor to teach this course. Also, exams were very conceptually easy and always short, but very little partial credit was given, meaning that if you made one computational error in a part of one long question, your score automatically dropped 10%."

THIS IS NOT A DIFFICULT CHEM COURSE BUT HE MAKES IT HARD BECAUSE HE DOESN'T TEACH. 
Professor Wiley is, no exaggeration, easily the worst professor or teacher I have ever had in my entire life. His ""teaching"" style is that he reads practice problems (very obviously the first time he's seen them, showing no preparation for his own class) from a different professor's slides (he didn't even make his own lectures) and then proceeds to get them wrong. For the first time in my life a professor is not just bad at teaching to the point where I don't learn anything, but he actually makes everything more complicated and confusing because he keeps getting it wrong. And the entire class knew. I stopped going to lecture and actually learned better self-teaching. I'm not sure how Wiley ever got a job here but he is truly an embarrassment to the Chemistry Department and Duke as an institution. I am ashamed to go to a school where someone like him is called a Professor."

It was clear to me that he prepared before classes and put effort into making the class a positive experience for us. He was good about asking for our feedback, offering office hours before exams, and communicating clearly when there were any changes to our usual meeting pattern. 
I appreciated that the lectures followed closely to the textbook so that if I didn't catch something in class, I could easily refer to the textbook. Especially in the later chapters, Professor Moreno-Hernandez started providing more examples of how the content is used in modern research. I found these examples both interesting and helpful for motivating our studies."

It was really cool to see how we developed concepts that allowed us to connect microscopic behavior to macroscopic behavior/observations.

When we discussed chemistry over physics I found my enjoyment of the course increased considerably, but that's more due to my personal tastes. Math and physics are inseparable form thermodynamics, so there's not exactly a way to fix this (it's also only an issue due to my tastes). I think the aforementioned change of focusing more on the conceptual side of the material rather than the derivations (which are covered in detail in the textbook) would make the class more interesting and accessible."

However, taking this class will allow you to develop the fundamental conceptual and mathematical toolkit to think about chemical behavior for first principles. If you're interested in developing a more quantitative understanding of scientific phenomena, learning thermodynamics and kinetics is a must. It'll be hard, you'll spend a lot of time reading the Big Red textbook, and at times it might suck a little, but I still think the knowledge you gain is worth it. It's a tiny class, so definitely make friends with your peers and support each other. You'll be going through it together."

You have to be willing to put in the time to understand the course. I would say that you should avoid this class unless you are very mathematically inclined and have a strong interest in both physics and chemistry. If not, take 301/302 instead of 310/311.

You will need to be motivated by something else and not lose motivation when your work seems to not get you anywhere. Don't be afraid to ask questions, as the other students are probably confused too. You will learn a lot, but probably still be very confused and that's ok. You will be able to interact with the material better if you have a strong background in molecular orbital theory. Highly recommend taking a class on that first to get the most out of this class."

This could be vague, in that we may have drastically different ideas due to not really understanding what we could/should be focusing on. A remedy can include the instructor acting like a 'guide,' where after students share what they found, the instructor can ask follow up questions or comments that point us to some specific direction. After students re-discuss among themselves, they may have a better idea of what to take away from the reading."

The lecture on Monday of strict information and then 2 other days of working through problems with peers allowed me to essentially get a one-on-one tutor feel during class time which helped to learn material much faster. This class sets you up amazingly for success and dependent on how much work you put in, you can succeed. I actually had a good amount of chemistry experience in high school but felt unsure of how well I would do in a chem course in college, so I last minute decided to take 99D instead of 101 and am so glad I did. I probably could have done okay in 101 going straight in because I had chem experience in high school, and I still struggled to relearn basic concepts that all my teachers always assumed we knew but were never formally taught. It is so nice for Dr. Canelas and Anna to go fully in depth in explaining basic concepts that are never really taught in detail, at least in my experience, and they never make you feel stupid for asking ""easy"" to answer questions and in fact encourage more questions. I have talked to so many students in this class that had barely any chem experience in hs and are extremely grateful for having this opportunity to learn they didn't have in hs."

The lecture on Monday of strict information and then 2 other days of working through problems with peers allowed me to essentially get a one-on-one tutor feel during class time which helped to learn material much faster. This class sets you up amazingly for success and dependent on how much work you put in, you can succeed. I actually had a good amount of chemistry experience in high school but felt unsure of how well I would do in a chem course in college, so I last minute decided to take 99D instead of 101 and am so glad I did. I probably could have done okay in 101 going straight in because I had chem experience in high school, and I still struggled to relearn basic concepts that all my teachers always assumed we knew but were never formally taught. It is so nice for Dr. Canelas and Anna to go fully in depth in explaining basic concepts that are never really taught in detail, at least in my experience, and they never make you feel stupid for asking ""easy"" to answer questions and in fact encourage more questions. I have talked to so many students in this class that had barely any chem experience in hs and are extremely grateful for having this opportunity to learn they didn't have in hs."

The instructor explained difficult nanoscale concepts with clarity and patience, which made the material approachable even when it became quite technical. The lecture slides were well-organized, and the pacing allowed enough time to absorb complex ideas.One of the most effective components was the guided discussion of recent research papers. This not only helped connect fundamental theories to real-world applications but also improved my ability to critically read and analyze scientific literature. Another highlight was the inclusion of problem sets that focused on experimental methods such as AFM, STM, and nanoscale fabrication, which helped translate theory into practice."
