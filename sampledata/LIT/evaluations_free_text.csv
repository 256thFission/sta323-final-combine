Professor Lubiano is very intelligent but often struggles with conveying information, so her lectures are quite disjointed and convoluted. Many times, she would leave no room for students to speak during the entire 2.5-hour class. There was a lot of assigned reading, but, as stated, we rarely discussed them and were instead lectured at about them for 2.5 hours. And, as the lectures were so hard to follow anyway, it felt like doing the readings was pointless. If you’re looking to learn something about literature, look elsewhere. There are many other excellent professors in the English department with significantly more engaging methods of instruction."

Also, the open discussions encouraged everyone to speak, which helped us see different perspectives. As the representative delegate, I could also see that our guidance was much stronger compared to other universities, where students sometimes showed a more superficial understanding, probably because the material wasn't always structured (in a class) and taught by a professor, like it is at Duke."

It’s a very complete class because you learn literary concepts that improve your critical thinking, and you also get exposed to important cultural and social phenomena happening in France. I would also say that you need to feel confident with your french skills, because the class requires a good level of understanding and speaking.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The conflict between ideological loyalty and material harm prevention—whether in the regulation of AI-generated disinformation or in the defense of capitalist market structures—reveal the same pattern repeats: ideology-first positions prioritize abstract principles even when faced with clear evidence of harm, while material-first positions seek to address concrete damage, even at the cost of ideological purity. This essay will show how this underlying dynamic shapes both debates over AI regulation and the longstanding capitalism versus communism controversy.In the current debates surrounding AI regulation, especially around deepfake imagery and disinformation, the divide is sharp. Anti-regulation advocates adopt an ideology-first stance, prioritizing principles of free speech absolutism and market autonomy. Organizations like the Cato Institute frame any attempt to regulate AI content as a slippery slope to censorship or dangerous government overreach. Similarly, the narrative that ""innovation must be free from interference"" dismisses the material harms caused by AI disinformation — such as manipulated election outcomes, voter suppression, and the erosion of public trust. The underlying ideological commitment to liberty and free market operation remains firm even in the face of mounting evidence that AI technologies, left unchecked, can profoundly destabilize democratic institutions.Conversely, pro-regulation advocates adopt a material-first position, focusing not on preserving ideological purity, but on minimizing measurable harm. They prioritize policies like mandatory watermarking of AI-generated media, platform accountability for disinformation campaigns, and transparency requirements for algorithmic content distribution. Their arguments are grounded in concrete evidence: AI models have exacerbated biases in hiring, deepened misinformation flows, and enabled new forms of exploitation and surveillance. Rather than focusing on deontological arguments about abstract rights, material-first proponents insist that preventing real-world damage must take precedence, even if it entails some limitations on absolute free expression or market freedom.This structure mirrors the capitalism versus communism debate throughout the twentieth century. Capitalist apologetics frequently operated from an ideology-first perspective, framing free markets and competition as ""natural"" forces immune to political critique. Ideologies of meritocracy — that wealth and success reflect personal virtue — mystified systemic inequalities, obscuring the exploitation and structural violence embedded in global capitalism. Even as ecological collapse, labor precarity, and extreme wealth gaps became more visible, defenders of market ideology dismissed these harms as ""externalities"" rather than evidence of fundamental flaws. Their loyalty remained not to empirical outcomes but to the abstract sanctity of market competition.On the other side, critiques of capitalism — including socialist and communist thought — adopt a material-first approach. These critiques prioritize harm reduction: alleviating poverty, protecting ecological systems, ensuring workers' rights, and reducing systemic inequality. They are less concerned with preserving the ideological purity of economic ""freedom"" and more concerned with minimizing the tangible suffering produced by capitalist systems. Whether through labor protections, wealth redistribution, or environmental regulation, material-first critiques demand that abstract ideals yield when faced with material devastation."

Readings are heavy and there are always way too much to digest. As if my mind is exploding. Nevertheless I like the way professor Pickford bombards us with so many different perspectives so that we can evaluate each of them and pick our standpoints.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","In the traditional model of ideological control, elites dominate mental production by distributing first-order ideological content: direct messages about what is true, good, or desirable. However, this is no longer the only — or even the primary — mechanism. In the contemporary world, not only does mental production distribute first-order ideology, but also the enforcement of second-order ideology additionally distributes first-order ideology. Seemingly neutral frameworks like ""free speech,"" ""anti-misinformation,"" and ""anti-hate speech"" are second-order ideologies that not only prescribe how the media should distribute first-order content but universalize first-order values through their enforcement. Thus, the public inherits first-order ideologies not only from the media itself but derive them from universal prescriptions of what kinds of communication are deemed legitimate.Consider ""misinformation"" enforcement. During the Cold War, elites not only flooded the media with anti-communist messages; they also framed sympathy toward communism itself as ""misinformation"" or ""subversion."" Thus, communism being bad was not only simply conveyed through the arguments the media made, but through ruling the discussion of alternatives as inherently illegitimate and a form of misinformation. In this context, ""misinformation"" as a second-order ideology was a direct extension of a first-order ideological battle: capitalism versus communism.In today's technocratic context, however, ""misinformation"" serves a different second-order function. The contemporary enforcement of ""misinformation"" on the surface seems to be a simple second-order filter for accuracy. However, such a filter spreads a universalist belief in objective truth — the idea that there exists a singular, recognizable reality that must be protected and disseminated for the sake of social cohesion and progress. Through this enforcement, public life becomes organized around a metaphysics of universal objectivity, where being properly informed is valued above all else.The antithesis of this is free speech absolutism. Media and education have long glorified individual liberty, often portraying censorship as synonymous with tyranny. The enforcement of free speech absolutism — treating any regulation of speech as dangerous — quietly installs this ideological lesson as a universal framework: that freedom is valued above all else, even at the expense of others' feelings, social cohesion, or truth itself. In this framework, we value our freedom over information integrity, emotional safety, and democratic stability, perpetuating the first-order libertarian ideal without openly stating it.Similarly, anti-hate speech policies reveal how second-order frameworks distribute first-order ideology. Modern pluralistic societies emphasize the protection of marginalized groups, and content celebrating diversity and inclusion is everywhere. The enforcement of ""anti-hate"" regulations carries this deep implication: that emotional harm and subjective feelings deserve institutional protection. Thus, anti-hate enforcement teaches that our feelings should be valued — that emotional safety is not merely a private concern, but a political and communicative standard that reshapes the public sphere.In each case, second-order enforcement distributes first-order ideology by naturalizing its assumptions about legitimacy, safety, harm, and truth. What appears as neutral procedural management — combating misinformation, protecting speech, ensuring emotional safety — is in fact the continuation of elite interests by other means. Thus, mental production is no longer simply about distributing beliefs; it is about embedding frameworks that structure the conditions of belief themselves. Today's ideological domination operates not only on the level of what we think, but even more profoundly on what kind of relationship to truth, harm, and freedom we are allowed to have."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- This course over-delivered in terms of intellectual history; aside from familiarity with first-generation Frankfurt School thinkers, I now feel more comfortable embarking on studies of earlier German philosophy mainstays--namely Kant and Hegel. 
- The asking for questions and then incorporating answers into lecture was a pedagogical masterclass. Generally, the pedagogical decisions seemed well-reasoned in what seemed like a difficult classroom (various backgrounds and interests).
- I feel like my analytic rigor in reading philosophic text has been strengthened, in a strictly logical sense, a historicist sense, and on the level of the form of the argument."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was very enriching and allowed me to develop several important skills and insights: 
1) Exploration of Austrian Postwar Literature and Film: I gained a deep understanding of four major Austrian writers and filmmakers—Thomas Bernhard, Elfriede Jelinek, Michael Haneke, and Ulrich Seidl—whose works are foundational to postwar cultural and literary criticism in Austria.
2) Close Reading and Film Analysis: I improved my ability to engage in close reading and film analysis, emphasizing how to critically unpack texts and visual narratives in relation to broader social and cultural contexts.
3) Understanding Representations of Violence: I explored how graphic depictions of violence can serve as tools for education and enlightenment, pushing myself to remain open-minded about the purpose and impact of such representations."

However, I learnt that often in academia, one has to bite the bullet and decide what battles to fight. As such I learnt to disengage from arguments that did not give me back fruitful ideas and were unproductive to thinking critically about the issues the artists' work that was the primary material in the course was trying to do. The actual work was often buried in the discussions about the artists themselves and the participants were not asked to refrain from make universal statements about the literary or film-studies based values expressed in the works. I learnt that when the discussion becomes performative, I must quietly save my labor for when I have the intellectual and emotional energy. I enjoyed quite a few of the readings, both primary and secondary, but found that the discussions were often overshadowed by manspreading in the workplace, an issue often unaddressed in the graduate seminar, a workspace often disguised as solely a classroom. Lastly, and on a positive note, I learnt how to identify textual evidence to dialectically decipher the place a given text occupies in the literary history as visible from the contemporary moment."

The harder texts were hard but he brought us through them and explained them so eloquently.

The midterm was mostly fair passage identification and some factual information (expecting the final to be similarly fair). The papers were actually quite fun to write because we could choose to write about any translations, parallels, and commentaries we thought were most intriguing, i.e. there was a lot of free rein. The group activities, like the in-class art project, were great. I enjoyed the guest lecturer as well."

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering. This coupled with an acute sense of self-awareness makes it hard to hate an exiled 14th century Italian man's charisma."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

All in all, I would keep the VARIETY of this course's learning material. I do think though that removing sugar and blood makes the course syllabus more coherent (and about theory and applying it to a cultural object) but I personally loved the historical memoir so I would prefer to retain that.

At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art. I also learned how to write a concise but effective paper, since our longest paper had a limit of three pages. Lastly, I learned how to appropriately analyze a short story by taking into consideration the plot, characters, author, and political/social implications."

I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

It was one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Duke. The readings are both thought-provoking and entertaining, as are the in-class discussions we had about them. By the end of the course, you'll be able to say that you're well-versed in modern European short fiction authors like Kafka, Joyce, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Mann, Sartre, Camus, etc. You get to do some cool out-of-class excursions too, like to the Rare Books library and the Nasher. The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently. I genuinely have no criticisms of this class."

The midterm was mostly fair passage identification and some factual information (expecting the final to be similarly fair). The papers were actually quite fun to write because we could choose to write about any translations, parallels, and commentaries we thought were most intriguing, i.e. there was a lot of free rein. The group activities, like the in-class art project, were great. I enjoyed the guest lecturer as well."

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering. This coupled with an acute sense of self-awareness makes it hard to hate an exiled 14th century Italian man's charisma."

And all of this knowledge was achieved through reading prominent, classic literature that we were able to learn how to interpret and interact with in order to gain philosophical insights from them. It was very interesting how each philosopher's circumstances drove their thinking, and how that thinking was able to be built upon and developed over time throughout many more eras and philosophers. And it was all about arguably the most important question one can ask themselves: what is the meaning of life? I was able to learn more about philosophers who thought there is an inherent meaning to life and what that meaning looked like to them, that there is not meaning to life, or that certain factors/experiences/mindsets could give one meaning."

There are a lot of texts, most of them difficult to get through and at a fast pace at that. There are also essays to write, and they are great opportunities to better understand the texts and improve your own writing. This is a class that is best experienced if you have existential thoughts yourself or are interested in learning about it. I think that is what motivates one to get through books by Nietzsche, Doestoevsky, Heidegger, etc."

Being able to stop and think about one's meaning and place in the world is probably something everyone thinks about at some point in their life, so exploring how others have thought of this question is not only helpful for one's own search, but also helps to establish a new way of thinking. I think that this class helped me immensely with this. The class is a lot of reading as you read a book a week, but all for good reason. If you can manage the amount reading and can spend time on it, it will allow you to make more out of the class and be able to make more connections and develop your own ideas. The grading is pretty vague, but seems to be mostly participation based along with three papers throughout the semester."

Historical and Cultural Contextualization: The course enhanced my ability to place literary works within their historical and cultural contexts. This skill was crucial in understanding the significance of each author's work in their time and its lasting impact.
Diverse Perspectives and Empathetic Understanding: Engaging with a broad range of authors from different cultural backgrounds greatly enhanced my ability to appreciate diverse perspectives.

The readings can be hard to grasp sometimes although theres no expectation on how much you grasp at initial reading and afterwards even just though you have a midterm and final paper where you are given many prompts to chose from and over two weeks to complete. The demand of the class also is minimal and doesn't feel like a lot since its not like you are being tested the next class on what you read; the class promotes you understanding and reading at your own pace the texts to be able to understand what is being said in class. Take this course esepcially if you want to read more and read these types of texts and engage with them in a relaxed and growth-centered manner but dont have the time in your personal life or other classes to do so.

Prof. Bassiri does an amazing job at taking the material we learn during the lectures and applying it to relatable concepts within modernity, allowing us to seamlessly transfer the knowledge we gain inside of this class to the outside world. One of my favorite things I learned was Foucault's theory of counter-conduct, which necessitates questioning external authority in a manner not conducive to external pathologization. Specifically, I was able to apply this concept broadly to my life, because I became aware that every time I purchase makeup, I'm feeding into the prevailing norm of beauty standards. From developing this perceptual awareness, I could subsequently begin altering my behavior, opposing corporation's capitalistic tendencies to monetize consumer's insecurities, changing the way I acquire makeup to fundamentally undermine the validity of the system itself."

However, more abstractly, I learned from Dr. Lubiano how to describe the social order more critically. I have a hard time describing it, but I am now better at seeing the structure of the world as it exists, primarily for her attention to affinity, feeling, and the ways in which structures or people come into being or power. I learned the latter from her lectures. I've never had a teacher who observes and criticizes like she does."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The conflict between ideological loyalty and material harm prevention—whether in the regulation of AI-generated disinformation or in the defense of capitalist market structures—reveal the same pattern repeats: ideology-first positions prioritize abstract principles even when faced with clear evidence of harm, while material-first positions seek to address concrete damage, even at the cost of ideological purity. This essay will show how this underlying dynamic shapes both debates over AI regulation and the longstanding capitalism versus communism controversy.In the current debates surrounding AI regulation, especially around deepfake imagery and disinformation, the divide is sharp. Anti-regulation advocates adopt an ideology-first stance, prioritizing principles of free speech absolutism and market autonomy. Organizations like the Cato Institute frame any attempt to regulate AI content as a slippery slope to censorship or dangerous government overreach. Similarly, the narrative that ""innovation must be free from interference"" dismisses the material harms caused by AI disinformation — such as manipulated election outcomes, voter suppression, and the erosion of public trust. The underlying ideological commitment to liberty and free market operation remains firm even in the face of mounting evidence that AI technologies, left unchecked, can profoundly destabilize democratic institutions.Conversely, pro-regulation advocates adopt a material-first position, focusing not on preserving ideological purity, but on minimizing measurable harm. They prioritize policies like mandatory watermarking of AI-generated media, platform accountability for disinformation campaigns, and transparency requirements for algorithmic content distribution. Their arguments are grounded in concrete evidence: AI models have exacerbated biases in hiring, deepened misinformation flows, and enabled new forms of exploitation and surveillance. Rather than focusing on deontological arguments about abstract rights, material-first proponents insist that preventing real-world damage must take precedence, even if it entails some limitations on absolute free expression or market freedom.This structure mirrors the capitalism versus communism debate throughout the twentieth century. Capitalist apologetics frequently operated from an ideology-first perspective, framing free markets and competition as ""natural"" forces immune to political critique. Ideologies of meritocracy — that wealth and success reflect personal virtue — mystified systemic inequalities, obscuring the exploitation and structural violence embedded in global capitalism. Even as ecological collapse, labor precarity, and extreme wealth gaps became more visible, defenders of market ideology dismissed these harms as ""externalities"" rather than evidence of fundamental flaws. Their loyalty remained not to empirical outcomes but to the abstract sanctity of market competition.On the other side, critiques of capitalism — including socialist and communist thought — adopt a material-first approach. These critiques prioritize harm reduction: alleviating poverty, protecting ecological systems, ensuring workers' rights, and reducing systemic inequality. They are less concerned with preserving the ideological purity of economic ""freedom"" and more concerned with minimizing the tangible suffering produced by capitalist systems. Whether through labor protections, wealth redistribution, or environmental regulation, material-first critiques demand that abstract ideals yield when faced with material devastation."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","In the traditional model of ideological control, elites dominate mental production by distributing first-order ideological content: direct messages about what is true, good, or desirable. However, this is no longer the only — or even the primary — mechanism. In the contemporary world, not only does mental production distribute first-order ideology, but also the enforcement of second-order ideology additionally distributes first-order ideology. Seemingly neutral frameworks like ""free speech,"" ""anti-misinformation,"" and ""anti-hate speech"" are second-order ideologies that not only prescribe how the media should distribute first-order content but universalize first-order values through their enforcement. Thus, the public inherits first-order ideologies not only from the media itself but derive them from universal prescriptions of what kinds of communication are deemed legitimate.Consider ""misinformation"" enforcement. During the Cold War, elites not only flooded the media with anti-communist messages; they also framed sympathy toward communism itself as ""misinformation"" or ""subversion."" Thus, communism being bad was not only simply conveyed through the arguments the media made, but through ruling the discussion of alternatives as inherently illegitimate and a form of misinformation. In this context, ""misinformation"" as a second-order ideology was a direct extension of a first-order ideological battle: capitalism versus communism.In today's technocratic context, however, ""misinformation"" serves a different second-order function. The contemporary enforcement of ""misinformation"" on the surface seems to be a simple second-order filter for accuracy. However, such a filter spreads a universalist belief in objective truth — the idea that there exists a singular, recognizable reality that must be protected and disseminated for the sake of social cohesion and progress. Through this enforcement, public life becomes organized around a metaphysics of universal objectivity, where being properly informed is valued above all else.The antithesis of this is free speech absolutism. Media and education have long glorified individual liberty, often portraying censorship as synonymous with tyranny. The enforcement of free speech absolutism — treating any regulation of speech as dangerous — quietly installs this ideological lesson as a universal framework: that freedom is valued above all else, even at the expense of others' feelings, social cohesion, or truth itself. In this framework, we value our freedom over information integrity, emotional safety, and democratic stability, perpetuating the first-order libertarian ideal without openly stating it.Similarly, anti-hate speech policies reveal how second-order frameworks distribute first-order ideology. Modern pluralistic societies emphasize the protection of marginalized groups, and content celebrating diversity and inclusion is everywhere. The enforcement of ""anti-hate"" regulations carries this deep implication: that emotional harm and subjective feelings deserve institutional protection. Thus, anti-hate enforcement teaches that our feelings should be valued — that emotional safety is not merely a private concern, but a political and communicative standard that reshapes the public sphere.In each case, second-order enforcement distributes first-order ideology by naturalizing its assumptions about legitimacy, safety, harm, and truth. What appears as neutral procedural management — combating misinformation, protecting speech, ensuring emotional safety — is in fact the continuation of elite interests by other means. Thus, mental production is no longer simply about distributing beliefs; it is about embedding frameworks that structure the conditions of belief themselves. Today's ideological domination operates not only on the level of what we think, but even more profoundly on what kind of relationship to truth, harm, and freedom we are allowed to have."

To be specific: we learned about Marx's earlier ideas of humanism (alienation/estrangement, species-being, reification/fetishism) and how some Marxists viewed them (namely, Jameson's view on popular culture), about Marx's later ideas of historical materialism and his analyses of history (including Capital and the value it represents, primitive accumulation, class struggle, etc.) and how some Marxists view them (for example, Malm's Marxist Ecology and Fraser's take on Marxist Feminism), and ultimately how these two Marx-es (among some others) could serve as a window to a 'larger Marx' - representing the entirety of Marx and his philosophy."

I also appreciated how she elevated ""colloquial"" knowledge to the level of the academy (asking us, for example, to include hypertext and internet sources within our final paper, or bringing up the example of the online forum on dragons). This is something I haven't seen any other professor do before, and as someone who has a few reservations about the nature of literature and the academy, something I didn't take for granted. Additionally, I enjoyed the format of having one or two students come up with discussion questions for each work we talked about in class."

Professor Lubiano is very intelligent but often struggles with conveying information, so her lectures are quite disjointed and convoluted. Many times, she would leave no room for students to speak during the entire 2.5-hour class. There was a lot of assigned reading, but, as stated, we rarely discussed them and were instead lectured at about them for 2.5 hours. And, as the lectures were so hard to follow anyway, it felt like doing the readings was pointless. If you’re looking to learn something about literature, look elsewhere. There are many other excellent professors in the English department with significantly more engaging methods of instruction."

The only real ""guidelines"" for the papers were in the syllabus, and that was just to tell you how long the paper should be. Papers are ""open to interpretation"", but it can be hard to know what exactly he wants. It would also help to just speak to him directly, as he is really a very kind professor. The big papers can just be a little daunting when you're not sure what to write about. Other than that though, great course, I would reccomend."

Also, the open discussions encouraged everyone to speak, which helped us see different perspectives.

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

However, I learnt that often in academia, one has to bite the bullet and decide what battles to fight. As such I learnt to disengage from arguments that did not give me back fruitful ideas and were unproductive to thinking critically about the issues the artists' work that was the primary material in the course was trying to do. The actual work was often buried in the discussions about the artists themselves and the participants were not asked to refrain from make universal statements about the literary or film-studies based values expressed in the works. I learnt that when the discussion becomes performative, I must quietly save my labor for when I have the intellectual and emotional energy. I enjoyed quite a few of the readings, both primary and secondary, but found that the discussions were often overshadowed by manspreading in the workplace, an issue often unaddressed in the graduate seminar, a workspace often disguised as solely a classroom. Lastly, and on a positive note, I learnt how to identify textual evidence to dialectically decipher the place a given text occupies in the literary history as visible from the contemporary moment."

Though I wish I had taken it in the first semester of my Ph.D. I think having had the first year to understand the particularities and cadences of a doctoral program made taking it in my second year the best time to do it. Writing is Thinking has made me a better writer, reader, and confident person as it relates to both. Receiving weekly feedback on my writing helped me hone in on my personal writing skills and begin to figure out how to change/adjust them. More than that, this class forced me to confront my anxieties around writing and my fears of being seen as not being good enough. Though neither of those has ""gone away"" per se, I am now more able to sit with them and take more responsibility for how I sometimes allow them to overwhelm me. Toril seems intimidating, but she is so deeply kind. So kind. Receiving consistent feedback and engagement with your writing and thinking from someone so deeply invested in both is not something that happens even 2% of the time in graduate school. Most people never receive that, and the few who do receive it too late. The class might feel scary, but you will be deeply cared for while not being coddled, and you will grow a lot in the process"

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned the intellectual and socio-political history of deconstruction pretty well, I'd say. The context(s) in which Derrida was making his interventions were a bit of a blind spot for me prior to the course. Although I knew Derrida was commenting on and critiquing structuralism, I did not understand how this fit into the larger issue of western metaphysics until taking Dr. Reilly's course. I also learned to recognize different moves Derrida makes in his deconstructions. The implementation of the logic of the supplement or the concept of play, for instance. I feel that I now have a confident grasp of these concepts. Derrida's critique of Hegel and the restricted economy also stuck with me, and I will likely return to it and even work on it in the coming years."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Critical thinking. It’s eye-opening for me to learn how Derrida’s approach to deconstruction challenges fixed meanings, hierarchies, and binary oppositions. 
2. Interdisciplinary Connections. Writing and Difference draws on psychoanalysis, linguistics, anthropology, and many other disciplines. For me, I learned how to apply these ideas to novels and use them as a strategy to write my final paper.
3. Close reading and annotating. To better understand theories, it’s important to use highlighting/ underlining/ margin notes on the text. I found it especially helpful to do paper reading in this course, because it requires more attention and thus leads to deeper processing and thinking."

It is very common with Derrida lectures/explanations to either oversimplify to the point of gross misrepresentation, or stick so close to the text that students aren't assisted in learning how to read Derrida themselves. Cate falls into neither trap, maintaining necessary complexity while answering student questions with engagement and generosity."

She constantly asked us to ask questions. She kept the course schedule flexible, which allowed us to return to material from weeks prior as needed. This provided a sort of continuity to the course, which assisted in my own understanding of course material. Dr. Reilly also chatted with students during class breaks and after class, donating her time in order to assist us with our questions or with concepts that we may have been struggling with. Her ability to put Derrida's work in context socially and politically as well as philosophically was uniquely helpful. I felt that this facilitated my understanding of course material. Although the seminar style worked well for this course, Dr. Reilly's lectures were of utmost importance. They should be kept at all costs in future semesters, and perhaps even expanded."

I feel as though I've gotten not only a good handle on Derrida and Deconstruction, but now I also feel prepared to take on the history of phenomenology, structuralism, and psychoanalysis. In this way, the course was stimulating on terms keeping me interested in how Derrida's work connects to several different disciplines/domains or what have you. The course also challenged me to read better, more closely, more carefully, and so on. This is perhaps the strongest way in which I was stimulated, as it provided me with a challenging set of reading practices that I implemented both inside and outside of the classroom."

It seemed that after our first exercise the door had been opened for more intense and thoughtful consideration of Woolf's texts. I had read some of Woolf prior to the class, but the structure of reading was a little fast paced. In high school, I think we read Mrs. Dalloway in a week and a half. This made it difficult to spend serious time analyzing the writing and the characters and everything that the book has to offer (which is endless). With Dr. Kronfeld, I was able to read Woolf's texts with more time and appreciation. This made me a better analyst and a more empathetic one as well. Dr. Kronfeld encourages critique and honest opinions but also emphasizes analyzing people and characters with an empathetic lens, as it leads to fuller understanding. This is demonstrated both in the works chosen and the ways they were discussed. I'm not sure if I've described three specific things, but it is difficult to quantify how valuable this course has been to me in my first semester. While I am a STEM major, I think it's important to engage our minds and souls with literature. This class is a great way to do that."

It wasn't that any interpretation was permissible, but the class recognized the living nature of meaning in the works which was dope. I like the short papers of analysis but I honestly found myself running out of room. Having spoken to other students, they faced similar issues. I think a page minimum is fine but maybe no maximum would be great so that I could write more. I like the interdisciplinary focus like showing the themes through music, art, and literature."

I also loved having the service aspect of the class. Getting out of the ""Duke bubble"" to engage with the Latinx Durham community was fulfilling and helped me create ties to a new community."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

The first few weeks the classroom was set up in a U-shape but they saw that within the large group students were not engaging as much so they split us up into groups of 3 or 4. This took away some of the pressure and helped start more stimulating conversations within our small groups but also within the larger class setting.

If you ask a question, you can assume he will not only answer it completely but also, in responding, give you at least three new and thought-provoking things to ponder."

The only real ""guidelines"" for the papers were in the syllabus, and that was just to tell you how long the paper should be. Papers are ""open to interpretation"", but it can be hard to know what exactly he wants. It would also help to just speak to him directly, as he is really a very kind professor. The big papers can just be a little daunting when you're not sure what to write about. Other than that though, great course, I would reccomend."
