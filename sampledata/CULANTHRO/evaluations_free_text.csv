This class challenged common misconceptions about race. For example, many people believe that there are genetic differences between the races, but on a genetic level, every human is more similar than they are different. Race is a social construct, created by an elite group of white people to subjugate and dehumanize other people. Though genetic races are a myth, society has been built around the idea that race is real, making its consequences very real and tangible."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Seminar discussions were very open and informative. They were about the readings and discussion posts we did over the previous week, so everyone came in with the knowledge necessary to contribute. Professor Wesolowski was incredibly knowledgeable about Brazilian history and capoeira, having studied in Brazil and researched capoeira for decades. She was incredibly kind, patient, and fostered an environment in class where there were no ""silly questions."" We could ask what we were interested in, and she genuinely cared about each of us as individuals. She became so excited when we showed passion for the topics. My absolute favorite thing about class is that she would often remember what we wrote in our discussion posts, or details about our personal interests and identities that we brought to the class. She would weave them into class discussions and make them feel a lot more personal. That effort on her part encouraged us all to remain highly engaged with the course."
