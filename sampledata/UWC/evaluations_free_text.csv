Please describe three specific things you learned.","First of all, I expanded my understanding of the concept of ""performance"". Performance is not only restricted to performing arts like instruments or acting. Basically, everything that involves participation and interaction between the performer and audience can be characterized as performance. We delved deeper into the history of performance theory and analyzed everyday performance from both the artistic aspect and the anthropologic aspect. It is surely insightful to link art with humans. Art can't exist without humans and we can't live and thrive without art.I also developed a deeper understanding of a lot of concepts and methods that I later used in my own research and artworks.I learned how to do peer review and technical skills to write a research paper and performance review."
