This adaptation is present across many marine organisms as well as all endotherms. I also learned about how different systems in the body such as the nervous and endocrine systems interact in order to send and receive signals and have sensory capabilities. In addition, I learned a lot about scientific writing, specifically how to write the abstract section of a lab report, and I got practice with writing the rest of a lab report."

Also, at the beginning it was helpful to split the day into classes in the morning and lab in the afternoon; that gave us some more freedom in our schedule. In addition, the professor put a lot of helpful resources in Canvas such as scientific writing resources and all of the lecture slides in Canvas so that we could access them easily."

In addition, the paper presentations were a helpful exercise in in scientific communication. The lectures themselves were intellectually stimulating because they were fast-paced but comprehensible, and they analyzed components of animal physiology from multiple different perspectives. I like that the professor would give us comparisons between human physiology and that of various marine organisms so that we could better understand the importance of different systems."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","One thing I learned is that the plastics that we use everyday are probably harmful even though nobody is really saying or doing about them, like silicones and plastic that smells. I also learned about chemistry from a biological perspective. The instructor facilitated my learning by being extremely knowledgeable about local biological and ecological systems. He was always open to answering any question during lectures, and lectures were set up in a way in which we would have time to answer and discuss questions. He seemed to always have an answer and an insight about the way something worked. He also would come up with questions too about things that nobody knows the answer to yet, which I thought was very insightful. Lectures with strong visuals were the most stimulating. Low stakes quizzes challenged me to think about the course content. I appreciated the humor in the class, it kept me engaged as well. Often we would discuss the content of the lectures during lunch. It was cool that our lab was focused on designing an experiment that could eventually be published. Time that I spent outside of class was on the lab project, while we were running experiments I would spend at least two our three hours working. The TA helped us when were stuck on lab problems. This is a cool class and it challenges the way you think about the world. I definitely recommend. The field trips were cool at the beginning, I never would have been able to see the inside of a blue crab facility. We also caught blue crabs to cook at a lake in NC."

Unlike other professors that focus on sharing facts, Dan presented us with information in a more palatable way. Additionally, the lab was extremely engaging. Our project was trying to restore seagrass beds by gluing seeds to clams. In the beginning, I felt the project would be impossible. Dan took an off-hands approach, but he believed in us and our abilities. When we'd get stuck, Dan would lend a hand, but for the most part relied on us to conduct the research project. In the end, I was proud of the work we accomplished and felt this was the most valuable lab I've gotten from a class. My only criticism for this class is that some of the lectures were a bit heavy. I really liked when Dr. Dan made his own diagrams on his slides, such as his spider drawings.
