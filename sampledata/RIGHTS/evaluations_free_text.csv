I've learned how to identify motivations for war and what characteristics allow it to exploit a country's most vulnerable populations.

I would definitely recommend keeping the class to this small size and retaining the discussion-centric class model. I also enjoyed the online discussion posts that we created beforehand, which helped me plan out the points I wanted to make in class the next day."

The what's missing paper was also a great way to express our feelings of what could be a new topic that could be introduced to the class schedule and Dr. Shapiro made sure our ideas where heard of and discussed with the entire class.

The reading in this class has been about a book a week. When I first began learning with Prof. Shapiro, I would spend hours and hours on reading and it was difficult to have balance. As I matured in the class, I learned how to read a book within two hours, write reflections in response, and have a critical conversation with my classmates about it. This is a skill I really value. Thank you.I learned a lot about contemporary South Africa. I examined and thought about various themes such as employment, what democracy means, popular engagement, etc. It's required me to think critically about a society I haven't existed within, which was an interesting experience.I also learned how to build a curriculum. In our ""What's Missing"" paper, Prof. Shapiro asked us to add a theme to our coursework. This made me think about what sources and discussion questions would make for an enlightening and interesting class. I thought that becoming the professor, in a way, was cool."

Even though this course mainly focused on the collective, I made concept connections to my personal life (i.e how to improve myself as an individual and my interactions). For example, one take-away I got in the class was the idea of always contextualizing a person's situation. After hearing this, I have and continue to try to apply this in my own life, giving others more grace and understanding. This class has also inspired me to join human rights initiatives on campus. I plan to do so in the fall."

Tim Tyson was arrogant, condescending, and the exact opposite of what I would expect to see in a member of Duke Faculty. To start, he went on an anti semetic rant in class where he said ""no one talks about jew power, but they quietly have power through the banking industry"". While I am not jewish, to see this behavior from a member of such a prestigious university was disgusting. One of my friends in the class is Jewish, and the fact that he had to sit and listen to professor Tysons' ridiculous comments were insane. I also feel very afraid to take action regarding these comments, because Tyson has been extremely vindictive throughout the semester. For example, the majority of the class got an extremely poor grade on the midterm. Instead of trying to help students improve, he said ""if I had taken the test I would have gotten a 100"". I was one of the fortunate few students who got a B (most got a C, D, or F) however he still refused to respond to an email I sent asking him for help in the class.

On the first day of class Tyson stated that we would have hard conversations that would help us grow. Not a single real conversation about racial relations in the south happened in this class. Instead, each week Tyson would get up there and ramble for the first 90 minutes of class. He is one of the least engaging speakers I have ever listened to. The only reprieve the class would have from Tysons rambling was when professor Williams would get up and sing. Her singing was amazing and was the only positive of each class. When it comes to the readings, Tyson assigned multiple expensive books that he wrote himself. I know that this is common for most professors, however it was extremely frustrating because the books were no different than what he discussed in class. Additionally his two most popular books have been discredited with his Emmitt Till Book being described in one news article as ""Tysons Tall Tales"". I have no problem paying for a book that will enhance my learning. However, when the book is filled with lies made up by a professor who does not care about his students I have a problem purchasing them."

Professor Tyson made this clear when he fell asleep on three occasions during the semester when he put on a movie. If you want students to engage with the class, it would be nice if the professor was at least awake. When he woke up, he proceeded to make passive aggressive comments about students in the class not paying attention. He was particularly passive aggressive to athletes in the class and he seemed to have a clear bias against student athletes. This is especially true for the basketball players whom he constantly belittled. Each class felt like a game Russian Roulette, where the outcomes would either be Tyson falling asleep, bullying students, or making problematic comments. It is truly hard to put into words how truly awful this class is."

While these lived experiences are valuable, the lectures do not delve deeper into the subject matter or provide additional information to enhance understanding. Instead, the professors tend to repeat the same stories and narratives, which does not facilitate further learning or comprehension of the material. The note cards allow students to formulate their own thoughts and make connections to the readings, but during class, the discussions are heavily focused on the professors' perspectives, leaving little room for students to share their insights or explore their connections to the topics."

Initially, a take-home midterm was listed in the syllabus, but about a week before the midterm, it was abruptly changed to an in-class midterm without proper notice or consent from the students. By the time grades were returned for that midterm, the deadline to take the class on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis or withdraw had already passed. Additional assignments were introduced after this deadline, and the final exam was no longer the sole examination, contrary to what was stated in the syllabus. The grading is stringent, with all assessments being written responses, and any deviation from the professor's expected answers can result in low or even zero scores, immediately impacting overall grades. Throughout the course, students do not have access to a visible grade book or platform like Canvas, making it challenging to track their progress as the syllabus and assignments continue to change unexpectedly. To perform well, memorizing terms from the assigned readings is essential, as outside information is often dismissed, and only definitions from the specified texts are accepted for full credit."

2) Ways of thinking - This course has allowed me to exercise critical and evaluative thinking by considering different perspectives towards similar events portrayed by different works and different artists or authors and how the differences can affect the way the audience perceives a given experience. 
3) Skills (language) - my general level of the French language has certainly also improved since I was encouraged to speak in class, which improved my French speaking skills, and there are many writing practices and that enhanced my French writing level."

Understanding the background and nuances of each work enriched our discussions and allowed us to engage with the content on a much deeper level.Moreover, the diversity of our course materials (in terms of periods, places, mediums, and content) was remarkable. From readings to assigned films, each piece was carefully chosen to complement and underscore the message that the migrant experience is far from singular. This variety not only kept the course dynamic and interesting but also broadened our understanding of the subject matter in a way that a more uniform set of materials could not.In short, the course was intellectually stimulating as it was. The diverse materials, along with Professor Reisinger's thought-provoking questions and insightful context, created a rich, multifaceted learning experience."

It is an opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to real-world situations, making a tangible impact in the community. This experience not only deepens your understanding of the course content but also imparts important life lessons in empathy, responsibility, and community involvement.Additionally, this course provides a deeper understanding of Durham's dynamics, allowing you to form connections and gain insights into the community in ways that might not have been previously apparent. It is an enlightening experience that broadens your perspective and fosters a sense of belonging to something greater than the university environment.Therefore, if you are prepared for a course that challenges you academically while offering meaningful community engagement, this course is an excellent choice. You will gain not just knowledge, but also invaluable experiences and connections."

Through various assignments and class discussions, I honed my ability to evaluate arguments, assess evidence, and identify logical fallacies, enabling me to approach complex issues with a more discerning eye. Additionally, I gained a deeper appreciation for the power of effective communication. Whether it was through written assignments and class discussions, I learned how to articulate my ideas clearly and persuasively, tailoring my message to different audiences and contexts. Lastly, this course exposed me to diverse perspectives and challenged my preconceived notions.

She lectured for half, and the other half was either time to work on a group presentation about the ethics of the case study we are discussing that week or a film to further our knowledge on the case study. I would keep the group presentations - they helped consolidate all the information that we learned because the case studies had a lot of details. I would also continue with the hybrid lecture-work/presentation format. It allowed us to have different dynamics so that we weren't only sitting in a lecture for an 1hr 15 minutes. I also think it is very helpful to have the quiz grades increase incrementally up until quiz 4.

It is engaging and relaxed, as everyone can ask any follow-up questions during the lecture. And I appreciate the way to conduct group work, especially the debate and the stimulation, whose focus is not on who/which group wins the debate. It is more like an approach to better solving the ethical dilemma or reflecting/ developing the ethic standards. This is unusual for me, compared to some other courses.

The lecture slides are helpful to guide you, but Dr. Stewart's lectures themselves don't get very far through them. The quizzes are very writing intensive and make up almost your whole grade, and they will shock you at first with the content and quantity. I do think you get used to them over time and grades get better, but if you mess up badly on the first or second quiz, then the whole semester becomes really tough. Definitely a very intense course, so if that's something you want, go for it. You'll learn a lot about ethics, but you will be under pressure for sure."

Would have liked to see current events consistently integrated into slides/lectures, as opposed to just having one or two lectures dedicated to dissecting Olivia Nuzzi and Mark Robinson or the election. Also could have included pieces from the Daily Show, Fox & Friends, etc. Also, Phil Boyce was an excellent guest and I would have liked to see some more conservative speakers or assignments from/for conservative sources (though I appreciate it's probably difficult to find people willing to talk to a liberal Duke class)."

This being said, I think we would've benefited more from group discussions and breaking off into smaller groups so that everyone was able to share their ideas and it could've been more conversational rather than one voice in a big lecture, one at a time. That would've at least been more stimulating to me."

In my experience, it is rare to be in a class in which the professor is consistently addressing current issues/events. I especially enjoyed this given the recent election cycle. Keeping up with current events is something that I value, so being able to do so through assignments, lectures, and class discussions was highly enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to make the powerpoints more engaging or perhaps limiting them altogether. Although I understand the informational value they bring, they can also not be particularly intellectually stimulating when taking up the entire class period."

Bill is a fantastic professor who makes lectures fun and will introduce you to a variety of interesting topics. You'll learn a lot about media and meet super cool people in the industry.

I don't think this is the fault of the professor but more the class makeup -- it was dominated by students with the same ideologies getting their news from large papers that skewed left of center.

We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning.

I really thought the frequent shorter exams throughout the semester was most helpful to take away the important pieces of each unit as opposed to having very few cumulative exams with high grade impact. This made learning less stressful and grade-focused and allowed me to actually focus on learning the material in a way that can be useful to the future.

They worked to build a space in which discussion was safe and encouraged, which allowed us to have frank conversations and ask questions without fear. I really appreciated the emphasis on not bringing in current events as we were learning, because it encouraged us to build the necessary background knowledge before drawing judgments.  The way that the class began-- starting twice-- set a powerful precedent for the way we examined this history and taught us the importance of taking an analytical approach to learning history.  I really enjoyed the readings that we completed before class, which tiled in the history and significance of various historical periods while allowing us to connect to them personally.  I also loved the format of the analytical responses, which encouraged continuous engagement with source material."

I've learned how to identify motivations for war and what characteristics allow it to exploit a country's most vulnerable populations. Furthermore, discussing topics such as rape as a weapon of war and the HIV/Aids outbreak across Africa has taught me about the importance of diction in how these issues are discussed and reported in the media.

The what's missing paper was also a great way to express our feelings of what could be a new topic that could be introduced to the class schedule and Dr. Shapiro made sure our ideas where heard of and discussed with the entire class.

This approach not only deepened our understanding but also fostered a sense of camaraderie among us.The respectful debates and discussions we had in class were a highlight. It's a testament to Professor Reisinger's skill that, despite differing opinions, everyone maintained a great deal of respect for each other and for her. Her kindness and thoughtfulness in guiding these discussions were truly appreciated.Additionally, the diverse range of readings she selected were thought-provoking and contributed significantly to the richness of our discussions.

Understanding the background and nuances of each work enriched our discussions and allowed us to engage with the content on a much deeper level.Moreover, the diversity of our course materials (in terms of periods, places, mediums, and content) was remarkable. From readings to assigned films, each piece was carefully chosen to complement and underscore the message that the migrant experience is far from singular. This variety not only kept the course dynamic and interesting but also broadened our understanding of the subject matter in a way that a more uniform set of materials could not.In short, the course was intellectually stimulating as it was. The diverse materials, along with Professor Reisinger's thought-provoking questions and insightful context, created a rich, multifaceted learning experience."

The volunteer experience is integral to the course and significantly enhances its value.Through this service learning aspect, you will engage in activities that are much larger than yourself. It is an opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to real-world situations, making a tangible impact in the community. This experience not only deepens your understanding of the course content but also imparts important life lessons in empathy, responsibility, and community involvement.Additionally, this course provides a deeper understanding of Durham's dynamics, allowing you to form connections and gain insights into the community in ways that might not have been previously apparent. It is an enlightening experience that broadens your perspective and fosters a sense of belonging to something greater than the university environment.Therefore, if you are prepared for a course that challenges you academically while offering meaningful community engagement, this course is an excellent choice. You will gain not just knowledge, but also invaluable experiences and connections."

Tim Tyson was arrogant, condescending, and the exact opposite of what I would expect to see in a member of Duke Faculty. To start, he went on an anti semetic rant in class where he said ""no one talks about jew power, but they quietly have power through the banking industry"". While I am not jewish, to see this behavior from a member of such a prestigious university was disgusting. One of my friends in the class is Jewish, and the fact that he had to sit and listen to professor Tysons' ridiculous comments were insane. I also feel very afraid to take action regarding these comments, because Tyson has been extremely vindictive throughout the semester. For example, the majority of the class got an extremely poor grade on the midterm. Instead of trying to help students improve, he said ""if I had taken the test I would have gotten a 100"". I was one of the fortunate few students who got a B (most got a C, D, or F) however he still refused to respond to an email I sent asking him for help in the class. I hope that there is some training given to Tyson in the future to fix his anti semetic and belittling behavior."

On the first day of class Tyson stated that we would have hard conversations that would help us grow. Not a single real conversation about racial relations in the south happened in this class. Instead, each week Tyson would get up there and ramble for the first 90 minutes of class. He is one of the least engaging speakers I have ever listened to. The only reprieve the class would have from Tysons rambling was when professor Williams would get up and sing. Her singing was amazing and was the only positive of each class. When it comes to the readings, Tyson assigned multiple expensive books that he wrote himself. I know that this is common for most professors, however it was extremely frustrating because the books were no different than what he discussed in class. Additionally his two most popular books have been discredited with his Emmitt Till Book being described in one news article as ""Tysons Tall Tales"". I have no problem paying for a book that will enhance my learning. However, when the book is filled with lies made up by a professor who does not care about his students I have a problem purchasing them."

Yes the subject matter was important and strong but the teaching was terrible. Never engaged us. On exam, they did not tell us how they would grade and gave us very broad instructions and then failed most of us because they said we didn't read but they never said it was a reading quiz. Just an exam and given 15 terms so everyone studied by looking them up and he graded so harshly. The other lady who lectured did not make much sense at all and would read from typed out transcript never from her own thoughts."

Professor Tyson made this clear when he fell asleep on three occasions during the semester when he put on a movie. If you want students to engage with the class, it would be nice if the professor was at least awake. When he woke up, he proceeded to make passive aggressive comments about students in the class not paying attention. He was particularly passive aggressive to athletes in the class and he seemed to have a clear bias against student athletes. This is especially true for the basketball players whom he constantly belittled. Each class felt like a game Russian Roulette, where the outcomes would either be Tyson falling asleep, bullying students, or making problematic comments. It is truly hard to put into words how truly awful this class is."

While these lived experiences are valuable, the lectures do not delve deeper into the subject matter or provide additional information to enhance understanding. Instead, the professors tend to repeat the same stories and narratives, which does not facilitate further learning or comprehension of the material. The note cards allow students to formulate their own thoughts and make connections to the readings, but during class, the discussions are heavily focused on the professors' perspectives, leaving little room for students to share their insights or explore their connections to the topics."

Initially, a take-home midterm was listed in the syllabus, but about a week before the midterm, it was abruptly changed to an in-class midterm without proper notice or consent from the students. By the time grades were returned for that midterm, the deadline to take the class on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis or withdraw had already passed. Additional assignments were introduced after this deadline, and the final exam was no longer the sole examination, contrary to what was stated in the syllabus. The grading is stringent, with all assessments being written responses, and any deviation from the professor's expected answers can result in low or even zero scores, immediately impacting overall grades. Throughout the course, students do not have access to a visible grade book or platform like Canvas, making it challenging to track their progress as the syllabus and assignments continue to change unexpectedly. To perform well, memorizing terms from the assigned readings is essential, as outside information is often dismissed, and only definitions from the specified texts are accepted for full credit."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","One of things that I learned across this course and ""South African Biographies and Autobiographies"" was how to read very efficiently. The reading in this class has been about a book a week. When I first began learning with Prof. Shapiro, I would spend hours and hours on reading and it was difficult to have balance. As I matured in the class, I learned how to read a book within two hours, write reflections in response, and have a critical conversation with my classmates about it. This is a skill I really value. Thank you.I learned a lot about contemporary South Africa. I examined and thought about various themes such as employment, what democracy means, popular engagement, etc. It's required me to think critically about a society I haven't existed within, which was an interesting experience.I also learned how to build a curriculum. In our ""What's Missing"" paper, Prof. Shapiro asked us to add a theme to our coursework. This made me think about what sources and discussion questions would make for an enlightening and interesting class. I thought that becoming the professor, in a way, was cool."

3) I'm now able to better emphasize in what way the journalist of an article is biased—and I can also avow that all journalists and people are biased in some way. For example, you can be biased towards the truth."

Not only did we hear from journalists and journalist experts, but we also heard from students like us who have ventured into journalism and encountered its problems from a fresh perspective. We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning.

By thinking about different ethical lenses, I felt like I could better sympathize with opposing viewpoints and form more informed opinions and stances. 
2. I also learned how to frame ethical tensions (with right/right, wrong/wrong, right/wrong) to better get at the core of an issue. I think having this skill has helped me to dissect important issues to truly understand their root. 
3. I developed my skills of gathering knowledge and forming an opinion about a controversial topic. I was able to combine primary sources and scholar analysis with the skills gleaned from this course."

Sometimes it's just not realistic to read 3 chapters of an academically dense book along with other coursework however, the information in these books are so so important for class discussion and exams. Class participation is a very large component of this class but as long as you come to class prepared, your grade will be just fine."
