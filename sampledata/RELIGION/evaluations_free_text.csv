Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I wo;uld like to say my focus was primarily on themes of humanism, identity, and racial capital. Each of these themes are directly connected to one another and approach the idea of the black radical tradition in various ways. For humanism, we spent the course reading Fanon, Robinson, Wilderson and other black intellectual thinkers who are redefining what it means to be and exist outside the concept of being human. This directly leads to our understanding of how this would affect idenity, as if one is not even considered to be human or considered to be lesser than human, their would be a sort of inferiority complex or psychological notion of subjugation that would become instilled in a community. Thus, the ideas surrounding racial capital come into the foray, for in order to further advance the rather insatiable hunger of capitalism and its systems, a form of racial order or hierarchy only benefits profit and labor. This course helped me in connecting some of these ideas effectively and providing thoughtful analysis when bringing together these subjects."

This made it so I always had lots of questions about the material, which I always came in to class prepared with, in addition to questions posed by the in-class lectures. I also liked that we went in chronological order considering the things we were learning about present-day Iran made sense considering what we had learned about Persian history/culture from the very beginning. I wish that we had a little more organized lecture/Powerpoint introduction to the topics we focused on earlier in the class; I found it really helpful later on when we started talking about the Shah/revolution, and think it could have been effective in portraying earlier themes."

The Masnavi contains a reference in the back that is especially important to look up, since Rumi makes many metaphors and references that those not familiar with aspects of the Islamic faith are likely to miss. Attar is more comprehensible but he is by nature a poet, and so should also be read in this way.Read the texts very carefully."

While visiting the pyramids was a highlight, the overall experience was stressful and lacked the immersive, enriching quality one would hope for in a study abroad program. The professor was not understanding of students’ well-being, often disregarding exhaustion, illness, or logistical delays, and dismissing concerns with comments like 'you're a Duke student.' His teaching style included frequent irrelevant rants and unsolicited political commentary, which made many students uncomfortable. Additionally, much of the course content felt repetitive and unimpactful — visiting similar sites repeatedly without meaningful academic engagement. Weekend trips were exhausting and rushed, leaving little time to actually take in the experiences. The professor was largely absent outside of class and trips, and offered little personal engagement with students.On top of this, there were unexpected out-of-pocket costs that added up quickly, even for group meals that were supposed to be included. Given the high program cost, this was frustrating. Assignment deadlines were rigid, regardless of student health or circumstances, and there was a clear lack of empathy when students were sick or overwhelmed.Honestly, there’s so much about this program that could be talked about for hours — from the disorganization to the exhausting schedule, to the uncomfortable moments with the professor. If I could do it over, I would choose a different study abroad program that better balances academic rigor with cultural immersion and student well-being. The photos might look nice, but they don’t reflect the reality of the experience."

I prefer Confucianism's focus on ritual in dealing with loss.3. I've learnt to appreciate writing more.

I loved hearing the students questions and listening to how the instructors found agreement and disagreements within their faiths, and how they dealt with challenging questions that arose. This was an opportunity I think people rarely get."

Professor Dougan was extremely funny and personable during class, and used many analogies and anecdotes to better describe an abstract idea or concept. Professor Dougan was easily able to simplify a paper or many concepts that took me many reads and left me with my head spinning and feeling like there was no point in the paper to bring me to a point of understanding where I felt I could explain it to someone else. He was very kind and respectful, and always took the time to understand our point of view or misunderstandings on a topic to better explain a concept to us. The readings on the course were all very crucial and built up a rigorous foundation for my understanding of religious frameworks of humanitarian aid in a stepwise manner, but also gave differing points of view to allow us to navigate and reconcile conflicting viewpoints for ourselves."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Throughout this course, I have been exposed to an entire array of writing and readings that I had never previously encountered, and that is so exciting. The ideas and beliefs that I had upon joining the class in relation to Columbus have further developed and are much more informed. This course has helped my thinking of connected histories and the ways in which we read/write/do history. The contexts that gave birth to Columbus have been very eye-opening and give solid grounds to how a character, as emblematic (in its many definitions) as Columbus, came to be and evolve into what it did. My thinking is certainly more robust when considering Columbus and his contemporaries."

I loved studying these historic texts and secondary sources with students outside of my own program, which allowed for new insights and understandings that have shaped the way I approach work in my home discipline. Dr. Martin created a lot of pathways for us to engage with the material, and I appreciated the weekly message board assignment as it allowed for me to engage my classmates and begin a dialogue even before I entered the classroom. This was especially meaningful for a weekly seminar where I only see my classmates once a week, and want to make the most of the time together. Dr. Martin did a great job lightly facilitating the class, but otherwise emphasizing a student-led discussion of the materials. He never discouraged us from pressing a topic or conversation further, even if it didn't directly address the overall seminar topic, and these conversations always ended up being very rich and linking us back to the ideas and concerns that make us interested in studying Columbus in the first place."

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering.

Also having the course basically exactly laid out at the beginning of the semester was helpful. In terms of the final project, it's been beneficial to have smaller deadlines and benchmark goals to keep us on track for the final submission."

Every class consisted of conversations facilitated by Crowley but kept going by the students. I learned equally as much from my peers in this course as I did from instruction. I was able to think of topics I thought I knew and understood from different perspectives. This was incredibly engaging in this course specifically because our classroom was filled with students from a variety of religious backgrounds ranging from Judaism to Baptist Christianity to Hinduism. Viewing American religiosity through the lens of a non-Christian was incredibly valuable.

Please describe three specific things you learned.",This has got to be the most interesting class I've ever taken. It was very inteluctally stimulating and I've learned so much. Learning about the three different major monotheistic religions is learning three specific things in and of themselves. Learning about religion in a historical context is one of the most interesting things to learn and I've learned to shift my thinking from a theological prespective to a historical critical one. It has helped develop the way that I think about religion in a theological context and also has just given me a different viewpoint on history in general because religion has such a pivitol role in history.

I think it's important to learn the history of our world and a great way to do so is through learning about religion and how it impacted previous lives and continues to impact lives to this day. I can't emphasize enough to engage with the readings and participate in the lecures. Keep an open mind and use it to engage with all three religions.

I prefer Confucianism's focus on ritual in dealing with loss.3. I've learnt to appreciate writing more.

Professor Antepuli, who taught us about Islam, was the only one I always wanted to hear more from, because of how engaging of a lecturer he was. I would suggest a total revamp of the lectures: more guest lecturers and case studies or real-world examples related to the religious concepts discussed (prompting us to apply the knowledge to practical situations). As well as the use of multimedia elements such as videos, documentaries, and interactive simulations to supplement traditional lectures and field trips to religious sites or events, allowing students to experience and observe religious practices firsthand."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

The readings were incredible & helped me reframe the way I thought about how I approached life.

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

He is one of the most knowledgeable Dantean scholars out there, and his enthusiasm about Dante is infectious. His slides are so well-curated and he has so many random fun facts, e.g. about Virgil's pesto recipe on the US dollar bill. I thought the reading assignments were well-paced for the most part. The midterm was mostly fair passage identification and some factual information (expecting the final to be similarly fair). The papers were actually quite fun to write because we could choose to write about any translations, parallels, and commentaries we thought were most intriguing, i.e. there was a lot of free rein. The group activities, like the in-class art project, were great. I enjoyed the guest lecturer as well."

He elucidated a lot of thoughts I had coming in when I briefly read about 12 cantos. He forced us to grapple with many dimensions of Dante's poem and challenged my many preconceived notions on love, free will, the existence of a soul, and the role of mentorship within life.

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering. This coupled with an acute sense of self-awareness makes it hard to hate an exiled 14th century Italian man's charisma."

This made it so I always had lots of questions about the material, which I always came in to class prepared with, in addition to questions posed by the in-class lectures. I also liked that we went in chronological order considering the things we were learning about present-day Iran made sense considering what we had learned about Persian history/culture from the very beginning. I wish that we had a little more organized lecture/Powerpoint introduction to the topics we focused on earlier in the class; I found it really helpful later on when we started talking about the Shah/revolution, and think it could have been effective in portraying earlier themes."

He was very kind and respectful, and always took the time to understand our point of view or misunderstandings on a topic to better explain a concept to us. The readings on the course were all very crucial and built up a rigorous foundation for my understanding of religious frameworks of humanitarian aid in a stepwise manner, but also gave differing points of view to allow us to navigate and reconcile conflicting viewpoints for ourselves."

I had incredibly stimulating conversations with my fellow students and Professor White rarely interjected. The tutorial style of examinations is great. Not a first, though, I cried after my first tutorial, but that was because I did not properly prepare. Once I did, I found the tutorial to be incredibly helpful in making me a better student."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I really enjoyed that this course was based in complete texts rather than just reading excerpts. Having read so many of CS Lewis' works over the course of the semester, I don't feel like there's any way to effectively capture the significance of his works and their nuance by doing excerpts. I loved the discussion intensive format of the course and feel like the discussions helped me to think more deeply about the material and challenged me to think about things in different ways. Towards the end of the semester, we started getting into groups at the beginning of class and were each assigned a chapter or section from the reading to recap for the class. I loved doing this because it helped me to refresh parts that I may have forgotten from earlier in the reading, helped to clarify aspects that may have been confusing, and highlight details that I may have missed. I also really enjoyed the exam format for this course (Writing an essay, reading the essay to the professor, then discussing the paper). I think this helped to strengthen my writing abilities and my ability communicate complex topics, themes, and ideas in a clear and concise way. While the following statement may not be very popular, I liked the fact that this class was technology free except for writing our papers. I feel like this helped me to be more present in class. The lack of presentation style was personally helpful to me because I often get bogged down by professor's presentations and sometimes distracted by the presentation itself."

He is an amazing teacher. The material was also extremely interesting. A class on the works of C.S. Lewis should definitely be permanent. Dr. White structured the course so that there was not an absurd amount of testing done (only 4 main assignments). He was very clear about expectations and was always there to meet and discuss the content. He allowed us to lead the discussion often which made our conversations very enjoyable.

He brings not only profound intellect but also a rare depth of character and integrity, as well as the indispensable traits of wit and humor. His commitment to his students is evident in the time he devoted to one-on-one tutorial feedback on our papers and two separate Flunches. I sincerely hope Duke chooses to hire Professor White; he would be an extraordinary addition to the university. I will remember this course for the rest of my life."

The fiction was also extremely stimulating, as if it was an onion with so many layers beneath that even a lifetime of study would not pierce through to the core. Regardless of the difficulties in understanding, especially The Abolition of Man, the course really made me think about religion and fiction in a way that I never would on my own, and those difficulties only pushed me to try to understand deeper."

This class does have a high and often dense reading workload but I never felt like we read anything that wasn't worth reading. The reading selection is very well thought out and clearly connects to themes of the class. I think the hardest thing about this course for me was the fact that I had an otherwise very heavy course load (I took 6 classes this semester) so I wasn't able to engage as deeply in the readings as I would have liked. This class is absolutely worth spending the time on but if you don't have the class, don't kid yourself into thinking you do. This may sound harsh but if you don't have time to make time, this class will be a waste of your time. BUT if you are interested in this class, it is 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt WORTH MAKING TIME FOR. I took this class my sophomore spring and so far, it is one of my absolute favorite classes at Duke (definitely top five and maybe even top three). Side note but this is may be the most well-structured class I have taken at Duke so far. Everything was incredibly and clearly well thought out. Never in this course did I feel like I was doing busy work."

He would also assign us different individual tasks such as summarizing a text to share with the class, to deepen personal understanding while also working on our communicative and analytical skills. We had several speakers and field trips where we were able to make contributions and ask questions. Real life and more local examples were used as parallels with class material to deepen student understanding."

While visiting the pyramids was a highlight, the overall experience was stressful and lacked the immersive, enriching quality one would hope for in a study abroad program. The professor was not understanding of students’ well-being, often disregarding exhaustion, illness, or logistical delays, and dismissing concerns with comments like 'you're a Duke student.' His teaching style included frequent irrelevant rants and unsolicited political commentary, which made many students uncomfortable. Additionally, much of the course content felt repetitive and unimpactful — visiting similar sites repeatedly without meaningful academic engagement. Weekend trips were exhausting and rushed, leaving little time to actually take in the experiences. The professor was largely absent outside of class and trips, and offered little personal engagement with students.On top of this, there were unexpected out-of-pocket costs that added up quickly, even for group meals that were supposed to be included. Given the high program cost, this was frustrating. Assignment deadlines were rigid, regardless of student health or circumstances, and there was a clear lack of empathy when students were sick or overwhelmed.Honestly, there’s so much about this program that could be talked about for hours — from the disorganization to the exhausting schedule, to the uncomfortable moments with the professor. If I could do it over, I would choose a different study abroad program that better balances academic rigor with cultural immersion and student well-being. The photos might look nice, but they don’t reflect the reality of the experience."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I wo;uld like to say my focus was primarily on themes of humanism, identity, and racial capital. Each of these themes are directly connected to one another and approach the idea of the black radical tradition in various ways. For humanism, we spent the course reading Fanon, Robinson, Wilderson and other black intellectual thinkers who are redefining what it means to be and exist outside the concept of being human. This directly leads to our understanding of how this would affect idenity, as if one is not even considered to be human or considered to be lesser than human, their would be a sort of inferiority complex or psychological notion of subjugation that would become instilled in a community. Thus, the ideas surrounding racial capital come into the foray, for in order to further advance the rather insatiable hunger of capitalism and its systems, a form of racial order or hierarchy only benefits profit and labor. This course helped me in connecting some of these ideas effectively and providing thoughtful analysis when bringing together these subjects."

I loved studying these historic texts and secondary sources with students outside of my own program, which allowed for new insights and understandings that have shaped the way I approach work in my home discipline. Dr. Martin created a lot of pathways for us to engage with the material, and I appreciated the weekly message board assignment as it allowed for me to engage my classmates and begin a dialogue even before I entered the classroom. This was especially meaningful for a weekly seminar where I only see my classmates once a week, and want to make the most of the time together. Dr. Martin did a great job lightly facilitating the class, but otherwise emphasizing a student-led discussion of the materials. He never discouraged us from pressing a topic or conversation further, even if it didn't directly address the overall seminar topic, and these conversations always ended up being very rich and linking us back to the ideas and concerns that make us interested in studying Columbus in the first place."

Each student presented select readings and was allotted a generous portion of class to do so. In this sense it forced more introverted students to explore ideas they would normally keep to themselves, as well as providing an opportunity to have students delve a bit more deeply in certain topics and allow for others with a more specialized knowledge to share their ideas. This particular method would be very useful to keep in the future."
