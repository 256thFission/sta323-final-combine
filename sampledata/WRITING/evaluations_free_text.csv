Currently, students are required to be filmed as part of the course, with no option to opt out. This practice may conflict with ethical standards and student rights, and should be reconsidered. While the course content itself may have value, it could be delivered effectively without the presence of cameras or content creation aimed at personal promotion. Removing the filming requirement and refocusing on a student-centered approach would greatly enhance the educational experience."

In the Duke library website, sorting articles and novels by ""peer reviewed"" helps show that the source is backed and approved by other authors, greatly increasing the chances of the writing to be credible. The final major thing I learned was how to format scholarly writing and the language that is acceptable to use throughout my paper.

Honestly, I had a lot of internal debate on this issue, and it set me to reach out for opinions of others as I was very troubled by it. I ended up centering my final project on it and it was quite interesting (and relieving) to do so. However, other parts of this class weren't very intellectually stimulating as many of our class discussions were quite shallow. I like the linguistics-related topic of this section but there were few moments where I could say ""wow, that was actually interesting!"", unlike my other classes in the arts and sciences. I wish more linguistics could be introduced in this class, and more seminal readings by reputed academics could be assigned."

The class is easy to follow other than certain periods of time right before assignments where you will need to allocate more time to this class.

The course is set up in a way that spread out the work for each major project, so it is important to stick to assigned deadlines to avoid creating a burden for yourself in the future. Additionally, taking time to actually learn from the readings and assignments is important, rather than just trying to get the assignment marked as complete. There are a lot of valuable skills you can take away from this course, regardless of your college major and career aspirations."

However, this course didn't really satisfy my curiosities in this vein this semester. Some class readings are quite interesting to think about, but it is mostly about the discipline of writing studies and rhetoric. The amount of reading was fair, and there were 1 or 2 assignments a week. The professor is a nice person and fair grader, but the classroom was not made very engaging and honestly I think class time could be better spent. Also do note that the course has two research project papers with field work components: the first project on slang analysis was quite fun, and the second was based on a debatable topic. This course is still being improved from semester to semester and I hope your experience with it could be better!"

Three specific things that I learned include: that if you are a master of attention, you are half-good at anything, value comes from creating new knowledge and then finding evidence to support your innovative thoughts, and that we can use different forms of attention to shape our reality. First, by being an attentional expert, you can understand how to adapt your attentions in order to have a greater understanding of any given situation. Second, it's important to be creative and generate new knowledge and fresh thoughts.

The course and his feedback emphasize writing with ""maximal meaning and minimal words"" through poetic expression, which has helped me write more concisely and meaningfully. In previous high school writing classes, I never really had to think critically, as they mostly required easy-to-BS summarization. This class will force you to actually write something substantive, an essential skill for academic writing. This is my first time having to write a long paper and a great introduction; he teaches you how to synthesize a well-written paper from the bottom up and taught me a lot about the iterative writing process, helping me overcome the intimidation of a big blank document."

The importance of intentional attention: I learned how paying attention often aligns with what authority wants us to focus on and how I can take control of my own attention. This method has helped me become more mindful of my biases and more forgiving of myself when I get distracted, fostering a healthier and more intentional way of engaging with the world.
	2.	The practice of serious noticing: This concept has been particularly impactful for my writing. By differentiating between surface-level observations and truly noticing the nuances of scenery, memories, and people, I’ve improved my ability to create vivid and unique prose. It’s helped me analyze what makes great writing stand out compared to clichés.
	3.	A deeper understanding of perception and thoughtfulness: The course has encouraged me to rethink how I perceive the world, helping me be more reflective and thoughtful in my day-to-day life. The course's insights on perception have not only enhanced my understanding of the course material but also continue to influence how I view and interact with the world around me."

The second portion of the course focused on our writing and our ability to construct creative new forms of attention. Professor Landes emphasized the importance of having the students select their own paper topics so that they could be more invested in the paper and have more expertise on the topic being discussed.

I ended up going to a lot of his office hours, which are plentiful (some days they would be 7+ hours long, a huge time commitment for professors), and ended up learning a lot hearing his feedback on mine and other students' writing. He also teaches us to be self-editors, with the philosophy that helping us learn a general intuition of what the problem is before immediately telling us is helpful in the long run."

Make sure you do a good job writing your first essay as it helps the writing of your second essay greatly. Pick topics that you are passionate about and are relevant to you as it will be much easier to generate ideas about those topics than a topic that seems “easy”. The writing you do in this class can truly benefit your day to day actions. Make sure you use your peers and David as a resource as they provide unique and insightful perspectives that are different from your own. Don’t be hesitant to ask questions and David truly wants you to succeed in this class. This will be unlike any writing course you have experienced before so prepare yourself and embrace this experience.

Because of the course's difficulty it is easy for some students to want to drop this class, however, I will say that relief and an intangible prize comes from sticking it out. Additionally, I would tell this student to take advantage of the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of academic writing from a expert, like Dr. Landes."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I genuinely feel like I grew a lot taking this class this semester, specifically as a writer, but also as a person. Rhetorics was never something I had studied before, or at least anything being labeled: rhetorics. I wan't familiar with pathos, logos, ethos. At first the course was very confusing but I quickly felt relieved when the teacher made us do a reading on threshold concepts. I think that's what made me realize that I was on the right track and the reason I was so confused was because I was learning threshold concepts. Apart from not only understanding the western definition of rhetoric, I then understood that rhetoric is an expansive concept and it is culturally deeply rooted. Apart from that, at first, writing reading journals was extremely hard for me. I didn't know where to start and so I would do the reading and copy and paste every single quote that resonated with me, unless it was usually one third of the text. I was always so overwhelmed by an information overflow that I did on myself. Reading Journals often took me a lot of hours, however, then, with Professor Li's recommendations I was able to get so much better at the journals in the sense that I was able to write them much quicker without sacrificing the quality of the journals."

I was able to learn from personal perspectives and adjust my writing ways with the help of my professor, guest speakers, and peers. Dr. Li ensured that everyone in the class participated and learned from each other. We were encouraged to think outside the classroom doors and seek the message in art, movies, and, of course, writing. I enjoyed being able to write freely and with a message. I also enjoyed how the first day of class was focused on getting to know each other, which allowed the class to become more open and discussions more involving. I think that near the beginning of the class, I was a little shy, but near the end, I was able to join in on the discussion and was able to speak through my writing."

Every class dynamic, reading journal and prompt that goes with it, every workshop, every little thing was well thought by her. Every class has not only a discussion but also different dynamics that helps you solidify the concepts you read for the reading journals. The reading journal prompts I find very impressive because she makes sure the students are weaving and merging and recalling past readings. I find it impressive since rhetorics is so complicated but you can tell she truly grasps the concepts and wants the students to do so as well. Personally, the reason why this course was so intellectually stimulating is because she made sure that the concepts we learned in all the past readings were being implemented after, instead of forgotten. I would keep the reading journals for future years because I truly think that the reason I learned so much in this course is because the prompts were challenging and obligated me to delve deep in the topics."

Dr. Li would go through every student's work, annotating and leaving comments that would help us see what we could change to improve our writing.

We never read about what might be some of the challenges of decolonizing rhetoric, how one form of decolonization might be more or less effective than another, nor had meaningful discussions of how this well-intentioned effort could be taken too far. I think a little bit more space for discussion and consideration of alternative perspectives would have made this class more intellectually stimulating."

In the future, it may be interesting to dive further into lyrical analysis of Taylor Swift. I think that could further add to discussions of literature and new articles. Also with discussions sometimes it was hard to get a word in because the same people would be talking back and forth. It could be helpful for students that feel less comfortable speaking up/interrupting to get their voice in to emphasize the importance of giving everyone a chance to speak so certain voices don't dominate the conversation!"

Although there were some miscommunication, I learned to keep track of things and submit them where they are due. Lastly, the peer review was also incredibly helpful - and gave me a great chance to see how my writing is interpreted by other classmates."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Clearer insight into how to structure clear and effective academic papers — we delved into sections such as introductions, thesis statements, body paragraphs, and so on, which really refreshed and refined my prior understanding of effective essays. I found the information on thesis statements and literature reviews, in particular, most helpful — for example, we learned how to effectively synthesize literature using a synthesis matrix, which is a technique that groups common ideas between sources together — it's definitely a technique that I'll be using for my other research papers going forward.
2. Incredible insight into Disney's evolution in terms of its content (especially in recent years with the Disney-Pixar merge and the introduction of much more mature topics) and the company as a whole! Reflecting on the role of Disney in producing ""edutainment"" (among other super fun discussion topics), for example, was super eye-opening.
3. Learning to think about the importance of the PROCESS when writing (rather than just the outcome) — while writing, it's important to critically assess each draft and to make improvements, and we can use techniques such as a reverse outline to ensure that we're clear in our writing, etc."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","1. The structure and sequence of our Low-Stakes Assignments really helped us practice specific writing skills and also sequentially fed into our final paper. This was definitely effective at teaching us writing skills.
2. Seminar discussion questions, where we as students got to prepare questions on readings to lead class discussions — it fostered such a fun and open discussion environment, and also allowed me to maintain consistent engagement towards the class
3. Recognition that life can get in the way, and the importance of maintaining good mental health — the course offers one Mental Health Day (one day off class with no class attendance penalty) and one Pixie Pass (a 72-hour extension on an assignment), and Prof. Andres is also super nice!
4. Super clear & organized website, with a super clear syllabus, super clear homework instructions posted at the start of every class, etc. — this really helped me stay on track with class progress
5. Handouts with clear instructions for all our assignments (plus handouts with notes for the different sections of academic writing that we looked at)
6. Our super warm and supportive and friendly class environment — much of that due to Prof. Andres' energy
7. I also really liked our semester overview document (which outlined what content we would cover & the homework due every single lesson), which was posted at the start of the year & helped me plan for deadlines for the semester — for future semesters, it would be even better if updated versions are posted on Sakai/Canvas after changes are made"

1. Public annotations of readings — it really helped me make outside connections (connections with other topics discussed in class, things I learned from other classes, other classmates' comments, etc.)
2. Seminar discussions every lesson (led by a different group of students each time, with questions written by them!) — the questions were super broad in scope & invited a lot of reflection (both about ourselves and society), and our class discussions would also yield new things to consider!Also, I really enjoyed watching (and crying) over our assigned films, and realizing how applicable the messaging of these films was to our lives (and how differently I interpreted them now versus when I'd first watched these movies years ago). The course offered so much food for thought and so many new approaches to thinking about themes and the messaging behind films — we looked at a lot of existing literature about different films (which also served as examples for how we should write our own final papers) in addition to watching the films themselves. (One approach that was particularly new and thought-provoking to me was the idea of parental neglect and resulting trauma in ""Frozen"".)"

Otherwise, I would say don't take this course if you are just looking for a fun writing course as--from what I've gathered from others--this course is much more intensive than other writing courses. I personally did not find this course difficult (although some of my classmates may disagree) but rather just really labor intensive. The time investment for a writing 101 course is what I found hard about this class. Lindsey Smith is a bit particular with formatting and that kind of stuff so just make sure to thoroughly read the assignment prompts. Also, I don't totally understand why this course requires the ethics co-req."

We then took a more analytical approach to academic writing by critiquing academic works across disciplines and applying critical thinking in writing. Finally, we practice synthesis by writing an academic paper on our own by reviewing and synthesizing other works. We took a collaborative approach to all of our works by having peer evaluation and reviews as a critical aspect of our writing process. Overall, learned a lot."

I also practiced reading dense biological articles, a skill I struggled with as I often got lost in the details like specific words and did not see the big picture of each paragraph.

From books like A Grief Observed and When Breath Becomes Air, I learned that grief isn’t a linear process and that it’s okay to feel happiness while grieving—it doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong. We also explored how different authors, like Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allan Poe, viewed death and how their beliefs shaped their perspectives on life, which made me realize how much religion and personal experiences can influence the way people see death and what comes after. Toward the end of the course, we focused on what it means to live a good life, what really matters, and the idea of carpe diem. Those conversations made me reflect on my priorities—whether it’s relationships, career goals, or just being content—and how to focus on what’s most important to me. Overall, it was a class that really pushed me to think about life and my values in ways I usually don’t."

In this class, there isn’t necessarily a “wrong” answer—just new perspectives or ideas that might eventually lead to the right one. She leads discussions in such an engaging way, with every question being open-ended and sparking new conversations. Her approach fosters a collaborative environment where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and building off each other’s ideas, making the class feel dynamic and thought-provoking.
This class was stimulating because it pushed me to think about philosophical topics and ideas that I wouldn’t have considered on my own. It encouraged me to reflect on concepts like death, grief, and what it means to live well, which aren’t things I typically think about in my daily life. The open-ended discussions and diverse perspectives made the class intellectually engaging and helped me explore these topics in a deeper, more meaningful way."

This class focused a lot on revision and the revision process, as it forced me to take info from the readings, connect it to my own life, and write about it, and then revise these writings in different ways. I learned so much about revision that I will definitely be taking with me to future courses.

How our origins with food are based on where we come from and what we were first taught about food throughout our lives. 
-I developed the skill of revision through drawing and presenting out your main idea. We used a technique of crearting an artwork with random materials that represented what our project was about. We then got anonymous comments of our peers who got the paper by just looking to the artwork and a short description. This method let me recognize what was being percieved of my paper and analyze whether or not what my intentions of the paper where reflected enough on my paper or not.
-I developed a deeper understanding of the importance and different ways of revising my papers."

I also really appreciate the flexibility of the second half of the course that allows us to create and work on our own projects.

They way it worked was every Tuesday we had about two to three readings that we had to write a 500 response/reflection about. Then on the second class of the week on Thursdays we had to submit a revision of that response we had made based on some specific idea she gave us. For example, one time our peers read our responses and had to choose a sentence and based on that we revised."

I feel like the workload for this is a bit much considering you'd have to watch films, read texts, prepare for presentations/discussion, and write (a lot). The main projects (research project + annotated bibliography x 10, film review, film analysis) seems like an okay load, but you also need to host a context report and a film discussion, write peer reviews for your classmate's work, and rewrite drafts of your work, in addition to watching films and reading materials. If you're not familiar with writing film review/analysis, it would likely take you a long time to get the first draft out, and you'd need to drastically change or completely rewrite sections in your following drafts. There is a 48 hr soft deadline for most larger projects though, which might be helpful."

Although I’ve taken two other college-level writing courses, this class stands out for how it challenges me to write on a deeper emotional level. Most writing courses focus on structure, genre, and analysis; this course, however, has encouraged me to turn inward—to examine my own life experiences, emotions, and internal conflicts as valid material for meaningful writing. I can perfectly encapsulate this into the following: 
- I’ve developed the ability to engage with my writing emotionally.
-I’ve come to see writing as a method of self-discovery.
-This course has helped me think in a more interdisciplinary way, especially through storytelling."

Dr. Sheryl M.’s approach consistently pushed me outside of my comfort zone, asking me to reflect more openly on my thoughts, emotions, and personal experiences. Whether it was sharing my perspective on a reading or commenting on a peer’s draft, there were moments when I genuinely dreaded having to speak up. Yet, over time, I began to understand the purpose behind this discomfort. By engaging in these moments of vulnerability, I not only became a more confident writer but also a more thoughtful communicator.

At the beginning, we completed specific, targeted assignments that worked on our skills in reading and analyzing papers. As someone with little to no background in this area, I really needed the basic, directed assignments to give me footing for our projects. As the semester progressed, we gradually gained more autonomy over what we wanted to write about. For example, for the first paper, we were given an assigned topic but could craft any argument we liked around it, but by the last assignment, we could do whatever topic or argument that we wanted as long as it fell under the umbrella of neuroscience. Overall, this environment gave me the necessary structure that I needed while also allowing me to explore my interests in the field."

Whether that be going to Duke's Writing Studio or asking a trusted friend/professor to read over my paper. Additionally, Dr. Parks introduced us to Zotero — a software that has made citing and annotating [difficult to understand] scientific papers incredibly easy. She also taught us strategies meant to enhance the ways in which we go about our research process (e.g. sifting through databases, narrowing our searches).

Please describe three specific things you learned.","My favorite lesson that comes from this course is the concept of imperfect first drafts. Before this course, I was so focused on making my first draft perfect – there was no way that after writing the draft that anything in my paper would change. I locked in my thesis, arguments, and evidence right away and gave myself no flexibility. This process often resulted in my paper not being the best it could possibly be, despite what I thought. Learning about imperfect first drafts in this course has completely changed my thoughts towards drafting, and has led to me producing much better papers than in the past. I will carry this lesson with me in future courses.Another lesson I learned in this course is to be open to abstract ideas. I feel like my past courses have always been focused on very concrete, foundational topics. I was not used to having to attempt to grasp an abstract concept such as the one we discussed in this course. I think I was pretty not open to the concept of the course at first, but as time has gone on, I really have bought into it and have enjoyed learning about such a unique topic. This process has taught me a lot about my personal learning and has opened me up to try to find new, other unique courses to take in the future.The last big lesson I have learned from this course is that writing can be creative and quirky. All my writing in the past has been super scientific, formal, and sophisticated. I really enjoyed combining typical academic conventions with creative, fun writing. This course taught me how to express myself more through my writing and use my own personal style, rather than a robotic scientific tone. I will definitely try to write more creative pieces for fun in the future."

The course is so much better though when you really engage with the material. At the start of the semester, I was not really willing to try to understand the material, and I learned very fast that that was not going to be what would set me up for success in the course. Now, I really do use attention literacy in my everyday life and am excited to continue learning how to adopt new interpretive frameworks in my day-to-day interactions. Make use of all class discussions and workshop periods. Discussions are really what get you far in understanding the course concepts and setting yourself up for success in your essays. Professor Landes is very willing to help you out, but you need to also put in your end of the work and work to develop ideas outside of class. The class does not demand much work out of you, except for really working to understand the concept. Once you do, it is super interesting and I really am happy I took the course."

Professor Asmuth creates a toxic environment within their class in which students, like me, who were excited about English and continuing to develop writing skills, are now turned off by writing and do not want to take another writing class again. This professor does not have a rate my professor at Duke yet, but I would recommend checking that website from their previous schools, as former students have also had bad experiences with passive aggressive behavior coming from the professor. I truly love writing, and it saddens me to have had such a bad experience in this class, I would recommend any other Writing 101 if you want to continue to develop your writing skills."

He was very available outside of class, and I found that this additional time with him was crucial to my understanding of the content and success in his class. He was also very open to student input and feedback throughout the course, and structured class time based on students' needs in addition to the content that needed to be covered. He also ensured that everyone participated in class and knew each other on a personal level through whole-class discussions and small group work, which facilitated the exchange of ideas and solidified everyone's understanding of the content.I also think that presenting attention literacy in a very accessible way at the beginning of the semester was very helpful, particularly with Pojar's cartoon. His deliberate use different media for our weekly readings showed us new perspectives on attention literacy, and was very engaging and informative.His assignments gave a lot of creative freedom, which made the class very enjoyable as well as applicable for my everyday life. I think that learning about attentional lenses and attentional literacy has helped me attend to every aspect of my life, from writing, to my other classes, and even to my everyday conversations.

I also think that it's a great introduction to academic writing and rhetoric, and a great way to make connections in freshman year because of how Dr. Landes encourages us to discuss things in class and help each other improve our writing.I'd also say that this class uniquely allows people to generate content in a radically new field of humanities research--attention literacy. Thus, this class provides a valuable insight into scientific writing and its structure--an important skill regardless of intended major.Also, Dr. Landes is a very understanding, engaging, and well-spoken professor. I'd recommend this class for anyone, as it provides a nice change of pace from lectures with professors who rarely get a chance to interact with students. Dr. Landes also sets aside time outside of class to speak with students throughout the semester, which has helped everyone in our class grow as writers and thinkers. In fact, I can confidently say that everyone in my class went to office hours at least once this semester."

I also learned how to be more logical and clear with my writing as a whole by constantly tying back to my main argument. Finally, I learned how to use academic sources in my writing by taking the conclusions of the writer and analyzing it myself in the context of my argument instead of cherry-picking evidence that only supports my argument."

If you recently took AP Research, I would advise selecting an unfamiliar W101 to gain new skills; however, if your research wasn’t STEM-related and/or you’re interested in the course description, check it out and see how you’re feeling during drop-add period. Hopefully this won’t deter you but Dr. Welsh doesn’t believe in an A+, meaning students have to prioritize every writing assignment."

I learned about such specifics in language use and wrote about the context and lessons from the author we can learn from simple word changes. I now see writing as figuring out the best way to transmit information for the reader rather than just a means of delivering as MUCH information as possible.

It was interesting to take an approach to writing not as having to follow a certain set of prescribed rules, but instead as making conscious decisions to achieve a certain purpose in our work."

While this consistency can be grounding as freshman, I also think expanding the physical ways that we write or show expression can allow more of us students to really tap into ways that our positionally plays into writing. I would have liked to see some more interpersonal writing/recollections that give us even short moments to connect our purpose in this class to our identity and purpose in our lives in the world."

I would find it more interesting if instead of two large papers we did small projects so that we do not get bored of our topics."

It allowed for different thoughts to flow without having to listen to a lecture the entire time. I think that this method is a lot more stimulating and allows for new ideas to be built off of different students.

I disagreed with the notion that other dialects other than SAE in academia are equally valid, and not wrong, just different. I also didn't know much about language and linguistics in general, so what we learned in the course was new and therefore made me think in new ways."

Dr. Asmuth definitely integrates writing with language difference and the way that they are able to teach it to us simultaneously really shows how great of a professor she is.

I also think that the style of essay writing and feedback received will be very useful in future humanities courses."

I don't think that the homework was too much it was very reading-heavy in the beginning and writing-heavy toward the end, but overall the workload was very bearable. The topic is interesting and probably will help me with future writing assignments and looking at them from a new perspective. Also an important aspect of the class was the research and I feel a lot more comfortable using the duke library website and finding scholarly sources."

Don't be intimidated by the beginning workload –– there is a lot of reading but over the course of the semester, there is more writing. Be open-minded! Some assignments or topics might not make sense, but I really trust Dr. Asmuth's ideas and teaching. I learned a lot of really cool stuff and feel more prepared for university writing and research."

I highly recommend I liked the classes and really connected with my peers and Dr. Asmuth."

Also it is really about how much effort you put in the course, you could get away with doing a ""light"" project but everyone here seemed to want to learn something and I hope you will too."

That being said, the class has a much heavier workload than other first-year Writing 101 classes, so be prepared for that."
WRITING-101-28_Asmuth__Charlotte_Fall_2023.html,Fall 2023,WRITING-101-28 : ACADEMIC WRITING.WRITING-101-28.,Charlotte Asmuth,7,What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future?,"I would like to say push yourself to think beyond the bounds of even some of the concepts we discuss in class when you begin writing. I think it's very easy for us to narrow our scopes, and write or discuss the easier more straightforward ideals about writing when we're presented with this new information at a new space. However, I urge you to be creative and to go for the thesis that feels most challenging. Many times your most authentic and pertinent work to you will be reflected in your work and - although this shouldn't have to be a huge concern - it will reflect in your grades as well. I think it's helpful to use these classes and the things we learn here at Duke to just broaden your worldview. Allow Writing 101 to be an opportunity for you to take note of how much more you've learned and more specifically to this class, be in reflection of how even the ways we speak and write can be so much more than a simple ""motif"" or ""common theme"", it can be symbolic of individuality, heritage, ancestry, and life lived."

And the good thing about is your teacher will put in double the effort you put in for this class they are very good at making sure every question is answered
WRITING-101-28_Asmuth__Charlotte_Fall_2023.html,Fall 2023,WRITING-101-28 : ACADEMIC WRITING.WRITING-101-28.,Charlotte Asmuth,7,What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future?,"Do not be alarmed by all the assignments listed on the syllabus. The reading may seem a little more on the intense side during the beginning of the semester, but it all begins to make sense and lessen as the semester moves forward. Dr. Asmuth is very purposeful with each assignment and class discussion they plan, so everything you will be doing will have a purpose and help you become a better writer! The two big projects for this class are broken up and worked on throughout the semester, which is very helpful as well in terms of work load. 
Other than that, Dr. Asmuth does a great job at building an accepting atmosphere where everyone is able to participate and become active in discussion. I would recommend taking this class if you want to become a more skilled writer and have some time on your hands to dedicate to this credit!"
WRITING-101-28_Asmuth__Charlotte_Fall_2023.html,Fall 2023,WRITING-101-28 : ACADEMIC WRITING.WRITING-101-28.,Charlotte Asmuth,7,What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future?,"I would recommend against taking it unless you really like learning about language, linguistics, different dialects, and the way language is taught in schools. Everything we learn is about how writing is taught/viewed by other people, so unless you have a passion for that subject matter, the class can get pretty dry. Class time is also boring. I regret selecting this Writing 101 class and not switching out of it the first two weeks. There isn't too much work but is harder than other Writing 101s, and the project at the end of the year where you have to survey or interview other people is a lot of work."

You will learn a lot about the in and outs of language, the tendencies that are shared between two or more languages and how they can be interpreted differently between various parties. Inside of class consists of mainly discussions and analyzing about assignments and outside of class is where a majority of the work is done where the student should make a good amount of time to complete assignments; about 1-2 hours a day."

I now know a much more effective way of beginning my writing and simply getting work done. I gained a lot of knowledge on Dolly Parton through this class as well. Though it may not seem extremely practical in the real world, she serves as a kind of model citizen for people, so it's important to have a decent understanding of how she has developed herself. I also learned more about the writing process and how writing isn't as restrictive as it is often taught in lower schools. This helped me to realize that I have a lot more freedom in how I write and makes me less worried about following arbitrary rules."

Additionally, the readings and podcasts we had to analyze during our first classes were intellectually intriguing because they pushed you toward considering other perspectives and ways of thinking when it came to self-development. In my case, each of these was thought-provoking because I had the opportunity to relate my experience to at least one idea explored in the book, article, or podcast, making it even easier to navigate and write my own scholarly personal narrative later on."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The writing process of the first and second essays showed me that I work better when I get more time to draft essays and that I need to spread out my workload to have a good product. Spreaidng out my time puts in buffer periods for when I have unexpected projects or large time commitments pop up like in the beginning of April when I started helping with a student Freewater Productions film set for seven hours at a time multiple times a week. With the drafts being mostly completion, that gives me the freedom to put in as much work as I want to when I have the time. Unfortunately for both essays 1 and 2 I had lots of work around the time the drafts were due so I was only able to put in minimal time for those but I could do that because of the freedom I was afforded.I also learned I can focus for certain periods of time and get a lot of work done but I definitely can’t seem to write rich text for an extensive amount of time so I had some struggles balancing it with other class work especially when it was a long-term engagement like studying. Fortunately, I believe I’ve learned a routine through this course on how I can lock in and enter the flow state that helps with productivity.Additionally, I’ve learned that pre-drafting experiences and feedback experiences are very helpful when I can see feedback about other people’s essays. This included the rapid-fire read-overs that Professor David did during class to check on our proposed attention situations and then also outlines. It’s shown me that the use of examples (other people’s essays) is important for my learning.I think my biggest lessons from the course about attention and attention literacy are the course concepts that I learned during this course. Learning about concepts like ethos/pathos/logos and heuristics and aesthetics directly showed me how I can apply lessons of this class to other subject areas and parts of my life."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned about rhetoric, and how vital it is important to consider it when writing. Additionally I learned about the different modes of conveying information, even beyond what one would consider conventional writing.I learned about Kairos and how it is important to take into account when writing, especially when the timing of the writing could affect its perception.I learned that one could go beyond writing in a subjective manner when it comes to important topics and that narrativizing or even making something poetry-like through the use of proper diction can help convey information in a manner that sticks more with the reader.I learned a bunch about medical narratives and the history and effects of cancer on peoples lives. Henrietta Lacks story was particularly interesting because it was the at the intersection of so many identities. Through the structure of the book I learned the many things one has to go through to write a story about someone else that happened to cause revolutionary change, and that rhetoric has to be taken into account when doing so."

This was a challenge, but ultimately it grew my skills in this area and I am coming out of this class much more confidence in my creative abilities in regards to papers, stories, presentations, and writing in general. Another skill I developed was fully analyzing all perspectives of a situation. I learned this through the various readings and analyses of those readings we had in class. This skill can also be transferred outside of class, as now I feel like I am more empathetic and able to understand opposing opinions better. A piece of knowledge I gained throughout this course is how to actually perform research, what makes a source reliable, how to determine the dates of the sources you should look for based on your respective research topic."

There were activities that made it easier to discuss topics, since they were in smaller groups and allowed us to view things presented in the text through a different perspective. An example of this is the Hmong story role play, where we act out one of many roles, each with different views on medicine and spirituality.

She allowed us to discuss in small groups on walks outside class, she allowed us to sit outside and discuss, and she also added to the conversation during large group discussion, which was extremely helpful. This facilitated my learning because sometimes it's harder to want to speak up in a large discussion environment, so the small groups allowed me to gain confidence in my opinions and also spend time with my friends in the class. Also, I really like the grading contract - it keeps the pressure off of grades and allows you to write to the best of your ability without fear that your ""best"" isn't good enough."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Dr. Parks had an incredible way of engaging the class. Each session was particularly tailored to class needs; she introduced and taught topics very well. The most valuable part was the step-by-step process of writing we engaged in with Dr. Parks' class. Rather than assigning a paper with a due date, we would have a different part of our paper due every class (research question, mind map, central claim, outline, draft 1, draft 2, final draft). At every step of the way, Dr. Parks effectively taught the class how to engage in that specific part of the writing process. The emphasis on peer review was also incredibly helpful; learning how to both give and implement effective peer review greatly improved my papers and showed me certain flaws that I may have missed on my own. The real kicker of this class was the topic of Neuroscience. As opposed to high school writing, where all papers were literary analysis, I was able to choose a topic I was genuinely interested in. Previously, writing had been my most despised subject in school, but Dr. Parks' class gave me a real passion for my writing due to the topic, her unique way of engaging the class, and her care to help each student along with the writing process. This was likely the most impactful course I have every taken, and I would keep every aspect of it for future years."

As long as we focus on those, everything else will fall into place. (The balls wouldn't fit into the bowl unless the biggest ones went first).

She begins each class by checking in on how we are feeling, and while it does feel a bit silly at times, her genuine intentions are clear. The class is conducted mainly flipped style, the majority of the work is expected ot be done outside of class, as we focus class time for presentations and discussions. I think this model works well. I would keep this and the several groupwork assignments. It is important to know how to work with others, and since the teams are assigned randomly, this definitely forces you to interact with people you might not have met otherwise."

My work on the two main papers we were assigned gave me the opportunity to practice ideating an argument, drafting, and revising.

Overall, I grew in this course to think about writing and the writing process in a new way. Scientific writing is so much more than making a statement or explaining research, but rather understanding the current state of understanding in a particular field, developing a unique argument that adds to the conversation, articulating your claim in a way that makes sense to the reader while maintaining scientific accuracy, and being receptive of feedback at all stages of writing.

I appreciated the collaborative nature in class, from peer-sharing in class to larger class discussions to extensive peer-review to cowriting a paper.

I cannot stress how underrated this course is, both in terms of workload and content. I think the content is especially appealing for STEM majors, since we covered so many fascinating topics like the technical aspects of LLMs (perceptrons, deep learning, transformers), first-order and categorical logic, and many current debates in the AI development like misuse, what it means for a computer system to be sentient, and existential risks. The workload is very manageable, typically just one reading per class and no homework. We did very little writing compared to other WRITING 101s, only having a 500-word midterm paper, a 1500-word final paper, and occasional 200-300 word quick responses in class. Professor Victor is very smart and approachable as a PhD student, and he always mentions recent AI news in class whenever he found something interesting. One thing is that we didn't get a whole lot of feedback on our writing throughout the course and not much has been graded so far, so I'm not actually sure what my grade will be at the end of the semester. Besides that, great course, learned a lot, and felt very intellectually stimulating throughout!"

It's a very intellectually stimulating class -- it genuinely makes you think and consider different perspectives, and exposes you to so many different fields within ethics that you probably didn't know even existed. Prof. Crespo does a great job at making sure the students get to have a say in what the class is about, and is very flexible with introducing subjects or papers that fit students' personal interests, as well as global issues."

I loved all of the articles that we were asked to read for class and given how much I liked them all, I think I retained the course content well. I also learned about the different waves of feminism as well as sameness compared to difference feminism which was something I was not very familiar with before taking this course. Given that my instructor heavily valued word economy, I will always remember one analogy he said to the class which was something along the lines of words being like money so writers should be intentional with what words they pick and to avoid words that do not push one's argument forward. So through taking this course I definitely think I have become a stronger writer."

Her feedback is exceptional, and the conversations we had about my work and what I was trying to express in my writing were so valuable to me. She's so good at taking your writing and helping you see things you might have not noticed/realized are in your work and identify points you could make to strengthen the paper. She guides you to ways to improve your work. She doesn't just tell you ""do this"" ""change this,"" or ""fix this"" - she helps you actually understand what effects different techniques/ideas/structure in your work can have and figure out what exactly is the strongest way to present your ideas and fulfill the prompt. I loved the conferences and I would absolutely keep those as a part of as many assignments as is feasible since I feel like that improved my writing and reasoning abilities so much."

I also liked how we always had so much freedom to choose what we wrote about. The narrative inquiry paper was about ourselves so we got to choose our guiding question, we got to pick our writing/creativity myths, and the academic research was about pretty much anything we wanted concerning creativity/writing.

In the first assignment, a narrative inquiry, I felt free to use metaphors, imagery, and experiences to paint a picture of my experience with writing, which I enjoyed. However, the last two assignments, a review and research essay, felt very constricted. While knowing how to approach these genres of writing may be helpful for my future years of college, I was expecting to be able to have my own creative twist and explore a topic that interested me; I wish I could have explored a topic that sparked my curiosity rather than a topic related to creativity or writing."

The content itself was very well curated and covered a variety of compelling and pertinent topics, many of which students could identify with and take interest in (and delve deeper into in a discussion post or essay if they wished). Many of the readings and books assigned were genuinely engaging and thought-provoking. Excellent course taught by an excellent instructor overall."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I like how we moved through different units beginning with fantasy to fairytales to analyses on power/prophecy. I felt like this helped give the class more structure, as each unit kind of built on the other, and we could easily tie what we learned from one book in conversation with another. I really enjoyed how ""chill"" the classroom environment was. Class felt more like a conversation between the students, rather than an intimidating discussion with ""right"" or ""wrong"" answers. Professor Turner often asked really thought-provoking questions when we do close readings of scenes that I would have never thought about before. She is also very understanding of her students' circumstances and allows late assignments so long as you communicate before hand."

It is nice to hear the group openly speak about their opinions on a book or story that we read, whether their opinions are positive or negative. Sharing ideas improves critical thinking, which makes the papers significantly easier to work through. I would also keep the little background lectures about the authors because context is very helpful."

Professor Turner was incredible at both determining the materials for discussion and mediating the discussion itself. There were many moments in discussion when I realized my worldview was shifting and opening up or when I reevaluated literature I had loved reading in the past based on the theory we were talking about. The lectures were also well done- in-depth enough to be useful, but concise enough to be engaging and digestible. I also have to say that I enjoyed the readings outside of class very much. Professor Turner assigned a variety of difficulty levels in our readings, enough to challenge us and push us to develop our academic reading skills without burning out. I did find some of the reading difficult, but difficult in a good way and very rewarding. Professor Turner was also incredibly supportive and accessible, which made the class a lovely and comfortable space to be in."

She is very approachable and flexible on extensions which really help throughout the semester.

She knew how hard it was for all of us to get out of bed, but is never angry when we show up a little late. She created a safe and comfortable learning environment that I was happy to be part of and have in my first college semester ever.

However, sometimes due dates for assignments would be very unclear, especially since she often copies the assignments from her previous semester's Canvas course page and does not always change the due dates. I found myself not having done one or two assignments because I simply didn't realize they were due - she had said one thing and Canvas said something completely different."

Professor Yan's excitement and interest in the topics we interacted with also helped in making the course more stimulating. However, I think the course could be more stimulating by breaking up the academic conversations with fun activities. For example, other WRIT 101 courses go to the gardens or attend lectures from visiting scholars; I think this course, and student's learning, could be improved by reducing time spent purely engaging with academic texts as it gets repetitivve and boring as the semester goes on."

You go over a lot of the same kind of content (although way more in-depth) relating to rhetorical analysis, argumentative skills, framing and supporting claims with evidence, etc. That is not unlike what you may expect in an intro to academic writing class, but this one in particular has a lot of readings associated with it that very much go a level beyond any kind of the content that you would have learned in high school."

While it is not the most demanding, this WRIT 101 is one of the more challenging and time-consuming courses. If you are a prospective English major or want to learn about the abstract concepts in writing, then you will probably like this course. However, for most students, who are just trying to get the requirement out of the way, reading 20+ page articles and writing 300+ word reflections on discourse communities before each class meeting will not be enjoyable, in my opinion. The assignments are not terrible -- three 2000 essays -- but in comparison to other courses which have three 800 word essays on Disney and nature, they are dense and completing them gets old quick."

Considerable amount of work, but will get most credit if you submit your work on time. Dr Yan is an amazing person, super kind, probably the most welcoming professor I've met at Duke. However, she is a new professor and needs time to learn how to teach effectively. She is trying her best!! However, the guidelines of the class are very vague - students don't know what to write about, and what is required of them. You won't know if you're doing well until the final grade of the project is released - and by that time it'll be too late to change anything. However, I feel like Dr Yan is really trying very hard to make her class better, so maybe it'll be better next semester."

As a result, we were able to develop our skills to write these types of essays. She also deliberately required MLA format for the first essay and APA format for the second paper so that we could gain experience writing both types of papers. She also provided very basic but also helpful guides to writing a general essay in case our high school english courses didn't prepare us sufficiently.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In my AI writing course, one of the most valuable skills I developed was the ability to craft effective prompts. I learned how to design and refine prompts in ways that elicit precise, nuanced, and contextually relevant responses from AI systems. This process required a deep understanding of clarity, specificity, and iterative testing to optimize outputs. By carefully balancing openness and specificity in prompts, I was able to generate creative and targeted responses, whether for academic essays, marketing ideas, or research-related tasks.Another critical area of growth was gaining insight into the ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated content. I explored the implications of bias, authenticity, and accountability when using AI tools, learning to critically evaluate outputs rather than simply accepting them at face value. This training helped me identify potential biases in AI-generated text and taught me how to adjust input parameters or address dataset limitations to create fairer and more balanced results. Together, these insights not only enhanced my technical abilities but also strengthened my understanding of the ethical responsibility required in leveraging AI for writing."

The collaborative environment encouraged active participation and exchange of ideas, fostering a space where I felt comfortable asking questions and engaging in discussions. Working together with classmates and the instructor to tackle challenges not only enhanced my understanding of AI writing but also helped me see how different perspectives can enrich the creative and technical process.The instructors' spontaneous explanations during class were particularly impactful. Whether clarifying a concept, demonstrating a new tool, or addressing a question in real-time, these moments provided immediate clarity and made the material feel more accessible and relevant. These on-the-spot insights often connected theoretical knowledge to practical applications, which made learning feel dynamic and engaging.For future years, I would highly recommend retaining both the collaborative components and the instructor's adaptability in responding to student needs. These elements created a supportive and interactive learning environment that was essential to my growth in the course."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The learning environment for Professor Crespo’s class is primarily an open discussion. We would read over a research paper or passage and discuss our thoughts on it with a set question that Prof. Crespo asked. Most importantly, Professor Crespo encourages thought-provoking conversations through frequent encouragement. He frames difficult questions in a palatable way while explaining confusing concepts if the class appears quiet and stuck.Our daily reading is challenging; instead, it is usually very dense research papers with little lay appeal. Professor Crespo's framing of the entire class as one larger discussion, combined with quick intermissions for explaining ideas, lets students retain information, unlike most other courses I am taking.Lastly, his assignments are about more than just learning the material. For example, he doesn’t create assignments just to help us further understand how AI will affect society through encoded biases. While that is a more significant portion of the class, he creates assignments so that we can focus on a writing concept like argumentation or audience appeal. Combining these methods makes students more knowledgeable about AI ethics and teaches them how to be better writers in a number of fields.I particularly enjoyed his assignment, which involved us writing a Duke Vertices Science Magazine article about a new large language model that we found interesting. The assignment made us consider our audience, explain concepts with examples while using our words wisely, and research a genuinely exciting topic. On top of all this, some students even published their articles in the school science magazine, which helped them get more involved around campus."

We could also learn how AI is used in schools and whether it is ethical to use things like ChatGPT. There are a lot of areas where the class can be expanded; however, there is also a minimal amount of class time to fit these recommendations.

Expect 1-2 hours of homework every class, so 2-4 hours of homework every week along with the major assignments that are very vague. Also, he has his grading scale which is a ""contract"" and every single assignment is worth the same amount of points (total out of 3). That makes it so much easier for him to grade and shows that he doesn't really put much effort into grading the work that he gives out. I loved the topic and discussions about ""education is life"", but the actual class and instructor fell below my expectations of a 101 level course.

Its honestly the perfect mixture of different things to do each day do I never really find myself board in the class ( even at 8:30) because there is just so much to talk about (which you wouldn't expect)."

The lense through which I was required to think under was challenged in many ways. I was also encouraged to speak more in class and engage in conversations about our readings. As someone who typically does not enjoy participating in class discussions or public speaking, I feel as though this course led me to engage in discussions more frequently. Through that, I felt more confident speaking in front of my peers and the professor.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Although the course was insightful, I must say that the way it was structured was relatively poor. We would go weeks without writing (which was unexpected for a Writing 101 course) and be assigned extraneous amounts of reading in that time instead. After a while, we would be assigned extremely heavy writing assignments, to compensate, and be given a very short amount of time to complete them. Additionally, the topics we were meant to write 1,000-3,000 words about, were often unrelated to the concepts we spoke about in class and seemed very disconnected from the course, making them difficult to write. For instance, one assignment that the class believed to be irrelevant was a twelve page annotated bibliography, one page describing each source, and then a two page commentary connecting the material. On it's own, the assignment sounds reasonable, however, the relevance to the class material was minimal and seemed as though we were prioritizing reaching a word limit rather than engaging with the content. It is important to note that after being submitted, this bibliography was never referenced again. In comparison to other Writing 101 classes, this course was far more demanding and did not align with the experience of my peers. Overall, the concepts learned in this course were interesting, however, its structure was incredibly confusing, and at times I questioned the relevance."

He also made everyone feel included as he would often bring others into the conversation and be sure that everyone's voice was heard at least once throughout each class period.

One way of thinking I learned was a ""me"" sandwich in writing, in which writing about myself would involve a paragraph sandwiching a quote in the middle, between starting and ending sections about myself. This method is applicable to other topics of interest as well, since it increases the focus of a piece of written work on the topic itself. One skill I developed was the ability to portray a story in an effective blend of showing and telling.

I learned that being vulnerable, even though pointing out the failures, can make you a very strong person. I have become more vulnerable with my classmates and friends. I have learned that sharing how I feel with others is a powerful tool for having healthy mental health and friendships. 
I got the insight of what the best teachers are like. I think it is a privilege to be Sheryl's student. She proved to me how the best of us is sometimes just being ourselves without exactly being perfect; something very contrary to what a lot of people think of Elite Universities. I think what is elite is to recognize what we have, make the most out of it, enjoy it in the moment, and keep facing your fear to grow."

I love that she placed so much emphasis on self-reflection and really thinking about who I am as a person. Sheryl always reminded us of the importance of staying true to who we are and letting ourselves be as unapologetically us. That has been helpful in producing much more authentic pieces of writing.
2. Sheryl always does emotion check-ins before the start of every class, which has definitely taught me the importance of taking a few minutes out of each day to pause whatever I'm doing really think about how I'm doing mentally. 
3. In the middle of class, Sheryl always leads us through a little stretching/yoga break to make sure we're taking care of our minds and bodies, getting some rest, and relieving some stress."

I loved exploring what it means to be human and what defines ""humaneness"" and how we use that concept to categorize not only other humans but other species. I never thought of science fiction as being an academic tool before this class and I now think it's the best way to engage with social dilemmas. I also used to have only one definition of academic writing (which was very intimidating) but I now see it in a much better and more inclusive light. My ways of thinking seemed to evolve with each reading and I loved how the assignments weren't comprehensive but rather our own engagement of the concepts (making it much more personal and motivating to complete assignments). Especially with the final paper being my choice, I was able to connect films, songs, and concepts together in ways I never thought of before (and it gave me clarity on what I want to pursue for my major)."

A clearer framework and a more student-focused teaching style would significantly improve the learning experience."

I also gained a lot of new insights about how to effectively interact with students from various backgrounds as well as effectively communicating with students that have various learning disabilities.

I wouldn't give up on being a writing consultant out of fear for the workload in WR 255. But know it is a lot of work (reading and writing), so don't expect it to be low commitment. I can also see how this course may be difficult or frustrating if you are not very liberal politically--just keep in mind going in, you may not buy into all of the ideas presented in this course. I do think the overall leaning of the course fits within a very specific ""university woke-ism"" that may not be palatable to some. But you are allowed to share different ideas as well as your reservations about the scholarship openly.

This organized scheme enabled me to efficiently track my learning.He offered us the chance to create our own class structure. From the first day, he taught us how to develop our own teaching methods. Gradually, he relinquished his authority as a teacher, allowing us to become both students and teachers simultaneously. This experience taught me creativity and hopefulness.In this course, I learned to be socially aware and humane. David emphasized how dialogue is the cornerstone of human connection and growth. A key concept, the I-Thou method by Martin B., was central to the course. It involves understanding the navigation (words) between different universes (people's minds) and their collisions (dialogue). The course showed me that dialogue is about being sensitive to those around us, a process of discovering and creating with a person rather than labeling them."

This was a refreshing respite from the monotonous learn, study, test of a typical Duke course that made me genuinely excited to both show up for the class and do classwork outside of class. The anarchic structure of the class facilitated my learned because there was no preset content that restricted students from learning what they collectively felt was important. If an unforeseen topic arose, it was welcomed and explored rather than shut down due to divergence from a set plan. Overall, I would say I would keep the methods of instruction the same for future years. However, this is not possible because the structure lay within the body of students that comprises the class and the teacher that comes along with it. So, perhaps keeping the instructor is all that can be done to try and make a class as successful and engaging as The Dialogue Laboratory of Fall 2023."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The class's structure was broad and wide open to student interpretation. Dr. Landes created an environment in which we found consensus about our goals in the laboratory together and pursued them as a group of individuals always trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. The course's lack of pre-imposed structure was filled by a group dynamic where we'd explore the parts of dialogue we found most fascinating, which were often influenced by readings we'd do before class.There was a predefined structure to the extent that we'd come to class and converse with each other, share our thoughts and try to understand each other better. Also, Dr. Landes would step into the conversation and try to steer it to match group consensus and address runaway analysis among the group, bringing us back to the emotional basis of the conversation.Overall, the structure was ideal for this kind of laboratory. We'd read the background knowledge required to understand our own goals and to create a mutual understanding about the role of our laboratory in achieving them, and we'd structure class itself around those goals dynamically. This allowed us to pursue the ideas we found most interesting to a much greater depth, and allowed us to pursue our experimental aims free of restrictive class structure.I would keep the entire class structure into the future."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Our assignments employed a unique and effective method for teaching dialogue. After each class, we were tasked with creating three distinct reports: a reading reflection, a field report, and a laboratory report. This trilogy was fascinating, as each component required a different set of skills. Reading reflections improved our ability to recall and apply the most personally significant concepts from the readings. Field reports challenged us to apply classroom concepts in our daily lives. The laboratory reports, being the most crucial, helped us understand our individual and collective roles in the specific context and timeframe of each class. Essentially, we discussed the unique or local knowledge we created in our dialogue class.From this class, I learned that the most lasting concepts for the future include: ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"" which highlighted learning and teaching as transformational processes and critiqued the current educational system's dampening effect on our desire to transform the world; ""Creating Safe Spaces and Brave Spaces,"" emphasizing the importance of fostering transformation and hope for a better world; ""Thought Leaders in Dialogue Theory,"" demonstrating that the idea of transformational praxis is not only advocated by Davis but has been systematically studied; ""Kairos,"" stressing the importance of speaking at the right moment; ""Social Choreography,"" encouraging a unique perspective on social interactions through spatial organization and people's responses; and ""Semantic and Poetic Meaning,"" contrasting how semantic meaning often falls short in expressing complex emotions like love, whereas poetic meaning can capture these nuances."

Aside from readings, this class was entirely focused on the people in Social Sciences 109 from 3:05-5:35 every Tuesday. The in-class dialogue was always entertaining because students had the choice to stimulate themselves with whatever dialogue they saw fit for the moment (kairos). However, a lot of my intellectual stimulation actually came from the weekly assignments. It was in these assignments that I did the most self-discovering and produced mind-blowing realizations or connections from both inside and out of the classroom."

We created a group mind that truly tried, and often succeeded wildly, at understanding the feelings underlying our curiosity and addressing those points we were most interested in seeing addressed.These curiosities varied throughout the year, but letting dialogue succeed in bringing them forward meant that they were addressed to almost just the right depth and were constantly the focus of the class. So, for example, this class was intellectually stimulating in that it tested how language choices effected the way others responded to language, and also in how other dialogic choices such as body language tone and positional landmarks created different effects on dialogue. Whatever the specific hypotheses of the class demanded, we explored with one another. We got to see the effect of our interests in action, answering them more holistically. Finally, we refined the skills of approaching others and creating a group mind in action, which is something that can only be learned from experience.Its a very abstract course in some ways, but when the laboratory starts cooking it becomes very real and very personal in a matter of minutes. I think seeing how our abstractions related to real emotions was the most stimulating part of the course."

The most stimulating aspect for me was the ability to express identity using both an intellectual and humane component. In every session, we were evaluated on a participation basis, which kept our brains active, encouraging us to think critically, openly, and humanely. I am considering taking this class again and feel that every professor should experience it too, as it fosters a sense of connection and applies the concept of 'scinus'—a genius arising from collective thought processes. This class has the potential to transform our rigid and erratic perceptions of growth. It encourages us to think collectively and individually, challenging the notion that society must be entirely individualistic."

First, I learned to truly listen - not just to words, but to the subtle layers of meaning, emotion, and intention that flow beneath them. Second, I discovered how a group of strangers sitting in a circle can create an entirely new ""collective consciousness"" through dialogue, where our shared understanding becomes deeper than any one person's individual thoughts. Finally, and most importantly, I learned that what seems like ""just talking"" is actually an incredibly complex dance of human connection, where every word, pause, and response shapes not only our conversation but who we become as people."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","- I learned to see conversations as a way to build meaning collaboratively, not just exchange ideas. I'm an international student, and taking this course with Prof. Landes has given me the language and toolbox to approach everyday conversations as fun toys rather than something we just ""do"". Notably, I don't think the course gave me ""new tools"" or ""tips and tricks"" for having conversation, but rather gave me (1) a space and a community to experiment with and get honest voices and advice about my communication, and (2) a language to explicate what might feel ""right"" or ""wrong"" within a conversation and what each action might contribute to a conversation.- I started recognizing that every interaction is shaped by interpretive lenses, helping me better analyze the dynamics at play. This idea was also formed in his past class (WRIT 101) and it plays hand-in-hand perfectly with this class. Two extremely impactful ideas that I continuously repeat to my friends that I've learned throughout my time learning with him were that (1) there is no such thing as an ""objective"" or ""true"" lens, and (2) particularities--not generalities--foster the relatability within a narrative/story. Definitely use the language we built in this class over interpretive lenses in my everyday life.- I realized the value of embracing ambiguity and using it to explore deeper, more nuanced perspectives rather than seeking immediate clarity. A lot of the people that come in are CS/Engineering majors that are very used to the dry-cut communication of numbers and fact (self-included). This course (and Prof. Landes' approach) give us a culture shock that ""useless"" conversations are where true humanity shows up and how people connect."

Landes was more like a skilled facilitator than a traditional instructor, guiding our discussions with light touches while letting us discover profound insights on our own. The weekly ""lab reports"" were genius because they forced me to process and analyze what happened in our discussions, helping me see patterns and dynamics I would have totally missed otherwise. I especially loved how responsive the course was to our group's specific needs - when we'd hit communication roadblocks or discover interesting tangents, the professor would adapt assignments and readings to help us explore those areas deeper, making everything feel incredibly relevant and personally meaningful."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I've taken WRIT 101 and WRIT267S with Prof. Landes back-to-back. I've had a lot of conversations him inside and outside of the class, and he has definitely earned my full respect over the year or so that I've met him. It's the type of respect that comes when you know someone is *extremely* convinced and in love with what they do and put in the time to understand it and study it well. Once you speak to him and understand the context of his experience in the past, who he taught, his hobbies, you gain more and more of an appreciation to his relationship with the subject. You start to feel like it is his literal baby or ""magnum opus"". Regardless, Prof. Landes leads the class with the mentality of trying to simply enhance your growth, not particularly direct it. He gives advice and treats people as individuals with separate interests and personalities, which makes the class have a very amplified personality. Some of the advice, experiences, and lessons he has shared with me have even contributed to my personal life in an extremely concrete way. Conversations with him are dense with lessons that are applicable to the class and beyond.As for specific components of the course that stood out to me, the focus away from the usual educational banking model and letting the class direct the conversations of the day is definitely the star of the show for me. Prof. Landes is insanely good at letting conversations happen and only talking when he has to or when it adds to the conversation. I felt a real connection with the class for sure. There is a reason why I felt so strongly about taking this class after WRIT 101--similar feelings were felt in that course."

I also like that when they could tell folks were losing attention, they would discreetly call on us and ask a question to bring us back into focus."

For starters, it held me accountable to finish deliverables for my thesis that had looser deadlines, which was very helpful.  Beyond that, I had fellow classmates stress a lot at the beginning of the thesis class because we were told to write a literature review without many of having learned what a literature review was, but this course had told me exactly what a literature review was and provided me with a myriad of best practices for writing one.  The readings are not too challenging but very rewarding, so do them all.

It was one of the most helpful courses that I took at Duke. However, the class does require a lot of time commitment, averaging around eight hours of work per week. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are looking to improve your writing skills and learn how to write a good research paper. The amount of feedback you get on all your work will drastically improve your writing skills. Additionally, Dr. Asmuth is very clear with their expectations, meaning that it is possible to do well in the course if you put in the work.

Subject positions - Acknowledging how our backgrounds lead to some of the perspectives we have and the way we express them, but also recognizing how those can be misunderstood by individuals with different subject positions and how to bridge that gap."

I at times overthink and over-intellectualize the process of making change without practicing it. Thus, this course allowed me to recognize that theorizing about change-making, while helpful, must translate into action, and that problems will inevitably arise throughout rather than require solving prior to action.
- I learned about the power and implicit rhetoric and strategy in silence, loudness, voice, invisibility, visibility, and physical space.
- I learned about the nuance and complexity of certain rhetorical strategies as not inherently all good or all bad, but as more or less effective depending on context and audience."

The first is additional labors, which at first seemed really daunting based on the syllabus, but slowly became an outlet to express new ideas and styles of writing. I enjoyed doing the additional labors because it felt like a way to apply some of the things we learned in class, almost like a ""checkpoint."" Also, the inclusion of documentaries and other styles like art styles, etc. was useful, especially since it equipped us to look at rhetorical choices beyond just word choice, tone, etc. Another thing I liked was the walk and talks.

I learned the value in taking notes in many situations, not just class lectures, and it's helped me to remember more details and synthesize information more effectively in both academic and non-academic settings. Professor Byerly's note-taking assignments were structured in a way that streamlined my notes while also making them more useful to me when I go back and check them.
2. I became a better listener. In addition to note-taking, Professor Byerly's assignment involving writing down memorable quotations that we hear in our everyday lives (from friends, colleagues, family members etc instead of just celebrities) pushed us to listen harder to those around us. This has not only made me more engaged with my surroundings but has led me to see the world in a different light thanks to my new focus on really appreciating the perspectives other people share instead of listening to respond.
3. I became a more confident and skillful orator. Public speaking is something that can only be learned by doing it, and we did it plenty in this class. At the end of the course, I not only felt more assured of myself behind the podium, but I learned what does and doesn't work so that I can give the most effective speeches possible."

The focus on opening up about personal stories (without requiring people to share beyond what they were comfortable with) made everyone in the class a person first, and classmate second. Combined with the consistent group feedback on people's speeches, the class overall felt incredibly collaborative even though we had very few assignments that were explicitly group work. Only one actually, if I'm remembering correctly, which makes it all the more impressive that the group was so connected without ever having been forced to connect with each other."

It created a vulnerable, safe learning space, and we all brought different strengths to the table that we could learn from. Getting peers' feedback on our TEDx Talks was super valuable too: it can be hard to notice things I can improve upon up at the podium: for me, it took feedback from my peers to see these things (like the person who had no idea how often they said ""like"" from a story Dr. Byerly shared)
I like how Dr. Byerly did not reveal the details of assignments until the week before they were due (with the exception of major assignments like our TEDx Talk) because it prevented us from over-stressing and over-rehearsing"
