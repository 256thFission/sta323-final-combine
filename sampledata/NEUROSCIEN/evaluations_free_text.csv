This dynamic fostered a supportive environment that encouraged growth and critical thinking. Additionally, the hands-on lab sessions were a highlight of the course, providing an opportunity to connect theoretical concepts to real-world applications.

For me, it felt like the culmination of the neuroscience major, getting to transition from textbook diagrams to real brains. Each week, you watch videos outside of class to prepare for an in-class quiz and application activity (lab session with the brains and/or clinical application where you are given symptoms that a patient has and have to diagnosis the issue). Dr. White's videos are very informative but take a very long time to get through and fully understand. I am a senior, and this class has been the most work of any class I have taken in my time at Duke. The quizzes are mostly fair, but you have to prepare really well for them, and it is very time-consuming. Also, note that this class is entirely a flipped classroom (so you do all the learning on your own outside of class) which can be frustrating."

It was also helpful to have this group of people to work with and bounce ideas off of especially as the work became more complex and we had slightly different understandings of the material or directions for the assignments. Lastly, even though I was not the biggest fan at the beginning, having to do presentations every week in a low-stakes, low-pressure environment has helped me so much to improve my public speaking skills which I know are very important for any job."

This is on the instructor as well as the department for not working that out.

While the papers we read were interesting, spending all week mapping anatomy was much duller than learning about the experiments they used to understand these circuits. Overall, I understand why this Flywire course was attempted, but I would strongly recommend going back to doing wet lab stuff. PERhaps Flywire coudl be connected with relevant wet lab work. I don't think staring at connectome data for an entire semester can really be stimulating in this kind of a learning environment."

Less group work, please. There should be some consideration for the fact that some groups just aren't good and actually inhibit learning and make the class difficult. There should also be more clear guidelines for the assignments and what the professor actually wants, it's always really mysterious expectations and the repetitive nature of the class (doing the exact same thing every week, ONLY looking at ORN circuits, ec) got really exhausting and burnt me out on the course.

You do the same thing every week and every single thing is group work, so hope you get a good group. Also the assignments are extremely unclear and seemingly made up on a whim, same with lectures. If you're taking it for the lab credit, take a different lab course, if you LOVE drosophila brains, maybe take this?"
