Please describe three specific things you learned.","A big element of our course was based on student presentations. This was particularly helpful because it improved my confidence with talking in front of people and also gave me valuable practice. I also learned about the process of reasoning through a model or paper, and how it can sometimes be difficult but there was an emphasis on being ok with failure. My writing skills were also developed further."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned about how models are used in economics and the real world. I learned about a variety of these models, some of the ones that stuck out to me were the Edgeworth Box, homo economics, and Schelling's segregation model. I also learned that making economic models is very fiddle-y, and that setting out to do something that depends on having a certain type of data will almost never go how you expect. However, I also learned that from interesting patterns in the data one can form new interesting conclusions."

If this sounds like a lot of work, I can tell you it definitely feels like a lot of work right now. Actually, feels very overkill for a FOCUS course in general, but maybe college is just hard. And yet, I am spending more time on this course (during these last two weeks) than on my other three courses *combined* and that includes MATH 221 and my foreign language.If you're okay with all of that and you are interested in learning about the history of economic models, you will enjoy this course. It is not a whole lot of work besides what I just described (and the 50+ page readings for every single class) and during the first half of the class each of us presented a puzzle of our choice, which was fun. If you are looking for mathematical or computational models, you will not find them here because economic models seem to just be lines of reasoning, like this causes this which causes this which actually causes this which was unexpected, occasionally accompanied by a cool looking graph/diagram that is often an abstraction for the sake of abstraction or to illustrate an argument better. Some of the models we looked at were cool, some of them sounded like just common sense or common reasoning."

2. Research skills, including data analysis and processing skills. During the course, I was introduced to the deductive reasoning approach to research that scholars practice in the field of economics, which was new to me and entirely different from my approach to, say, a history research project. I learned how to write a literature review and how it's important, find and check the quality of a dataset, and manipulate a data set with a statistical analysis (taking an RNG sample, doing a chi-squared test for significance, etc. - things I'd only learned about in theory in prior statistics classes).

I also quite liked Professor Taylor's lectures, I found them very well organized/structured, and he also brings needed levity to class that would otehrwise feel dense given the subject covered.

It offers an overview of some of the workhorse models found in the literature and asks students to not only get acquainted with them but also to think about their limitations; this develops one's critical thinking skills and spurs good discussions about how to approach issues in modelling as a social scientist.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","In the first half of the course, the structure of the course felt like a natural progression through the overarching topic of estimation, as each lecture blended into the next as more concepts got introduced and their relation with the previous discussions became more clear upon further studying and revising. However, I found Prof. Michael's lecturing style a bit disorganized and at times difficult to get a proper grip on. One thing that might seem minor, but that greatly impacted how the flow of class and how productive the lectures were, was that his handwriting was a tad small, such that it was frequently difficult to see from afar what was being written on the board and people had to interrup the lecture to ask for clarification. As for the second half of the course, I found Prof. Anna's organization laudable, her lecturing style is self-contained and her explanations very clearly transmitted. When it comes to the TA sessions, I think both Gianna and Haonan have greatly improved in their ability to transmit their knowledge, answer clearly to student's questions, and be overall more helpful teaching assistants. I really appreciate their patience and helpfulness as TAs."

If you're not gonna do Finance or Macro, the second part—time series—might be less relevant. While it's still useful to have some exposure to time series methods, keep in mind that this is a Ph.D.-level course and is quite theoretical."

The estimation portion suffers from that slightly disorganized lectures, while the time series analysis portion only gets interesting in the last couple of lectures when we actually get to see more sophisticated models."
