I say this in the most sincere way possible. I've taken this course 3 times now, (hopefully going to take it once more for my final semester, fingers crossed), and not only can I say that I have significantly improved my basketball skills, I can also say that this class has helped me grow as a person. The course itself is surprisingly very balanced, (I would have thought that mostly insane basketball players would show up), yet the class is a mix of new players and experienced players alike. Nobody is unbeatable, and Coach makes the teams in such a way that you find yourself feeling like you can make a difference in the game, even if you aren't the strongest player. So to any prospective student that is thinking about this class, I would say that you will improve your game a ton, but also learn some valuable life lessons, and gain a valuable mentor for the future."

It starts with the very basics of tennis and you aren't able to rally/play games until a couple weeks into the semester.

Having a semester-long yoga class provides a unique opportunity to practice alongside the same people for three months! While you can't necessarily do some of the things you do around public yoga classes to build community (grab a post-session beer or do a pre-session run/workout), I'm sure there are more collaborative exercises we could do at the beginning of class (like when we introduced our classmate next to us)."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","One of the most impactful lessons was the emphasis on modeling the behavior and attitude you want to see in others. As we discussed in class, great leaders in sports earn respect by demonstrating commitment, discipline, and resilience on and off the field. For example, I learned how small actions, like showing up early to practice or maintaining a positive attitude during tough moments, can set the tone for the entire team. This concept has inspired me to focus on being consistent and accountable in my own leadership. Another key takeaway was the concept of situational leadership. The course taught me that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to leading a team. Depending on the group’s needs whether it’s motivating after a loss or strategizing for a game leaders must adapt their style. I practiced this skill through group activities, where I experimented with being more directive in some cases and collaborative in others. This flexibility has made me more effective in supporting teammates and achieving shared goals."
