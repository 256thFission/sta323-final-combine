Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I appreciated that this course is relatively flexible to accommodate different learning styles. Prof. You's lectures, the lecture slides, and the hands-on exercises in class all provided their own benefits to learning. I found myself really clicking with some lectures, while other concepts I learned better by toying with the code and studying the lecture slides on my own time.
I found the homework assignments appropriately challenging. For most questions, I had to dedicate a fair amount of time to reviewing lecture material, researching online, and trying different approaches, but I never found them impossible or overly frustrating to complete. The group project topic my group selected was well outside of my knowledge base, but I found a niche to occupy and did find I learned a lot about a subject I was previously unfamiliar with (though I suspect the outcomes of this assignment depend strongly on the individual group members).
I also found Prof. You's AI policy well-articulated and constructive to the learning environment. I feel that the assignments were worded very well to encourage positive use of AI without sacrificing understanding or engagement with the content."

While the material we covered is universal and able to accommodate a variety of physical systems, I appreciated having a context to physically intuit the behaviors we observed. I also appreciated developing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of biological systems.
I also feel that the course made me a more competent and confident programmer overall.

Allot plenty of time to complete the course assignments. The overall workload for the course is very manageable, but it is concentrated into a handful of relatively work-intensive assignments.
2. Use resources to your advantage, including the provided course materials, classmates, online resources, and AI assistance - whatever works best for you personally.

I found the homework assignments appropriately challenging.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course, unsurprisingly, gives an excellent overview of geometric techniques one can use to solve algorithmic problems, which differ in some interesting ways from what one might learn in a more general algorithms course.  Of particular emphasis are ways to use geometry to design and employ efficient data structures, notions of geometric duality which can make a hard problem in one setting much easier in another, and the ubiquitous application of geometric insights to diverse areas, such as convex optimization, motion planning, databases, and machine learning to name a few.More abstractly, in the words of Galileo: ""Philosophy [nature] is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth."" This course gives someone at least a very dim flashlight."

My only advice is that if you can, get in the habit of reading the book and other supplementary material at the start of the semester, even if you're keeping up with lectures. It helps with the homework tremendously, and also makes it much easier to see where Agarwal is going in lecture which I sometimes found difficult in the middle of the description of the algorithm. The homeworks are also pretty tough, but there's only 4 of them and you have about 2 weeks for each."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course, unsurprisingly, gives an excellent overview of geometric techniques one can use to solve algorithmic problems, which differ in some interesting ways from what one might learn in a more general algorithms course.  Of particular emphasis are ways to use geometry to design and employ efficient data structures, notions of geometric duality which can make a hard problem in one setting much easier in another, and the ubiquitous application of geometric insights to diverse areas, such as convex optimization, motion planning, databases, and machine learning to name a few.More abstractly, in the words of Galileo: ""Philosophy [nature] is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth."" This course gives someone at least a very dim flashlight."

You will learn to think about different theoretical and applied problems through a geometric lens. However, be prepared to spend lots of time thinking when you do the homeworks -- they are not easy by any measure. However, they are very rewarding, and if you are willing to put in the time to think, you will get a lot out of a class."

My only advice is that if you can, get in the habit of reading the book and other supplementary material at the start of the semester, even if you're keeping up with lectures. It helps with the homework tremendously, and also makes it much easier to see where Agarwal is going in lecture which I sometimes found difficult in the middle of the description of the algorithm. The homeworks are also pretty tough, but there's only 4 of them and you have about 2 weeks for each."
