Please describe three specific things you learned.",This course introduced the meaning behind race is not biological and explored multiple facets of that idea. I learned how to be more comfortable talking about race and the expansive and uncomfortable history in our country and the world in general. I also learned about the research objective with a lot of studies focused on race.

It pushed students to think critically about cultural applications of subjects that have stereotyped biological bases, such as sports. It could have been more stimulating with case study examples from present day - perhaps linking the lecture topic with a recent or historical misconception about race and genetics."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In Dr. Charmaine Royal's Race, Genomics, and Society course, I developed a deeper understanding of how race, though a social construct, significantly impacts scientific research and healthcare. I learned to critically evaluate the use of racial categories in genomic studies and how they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes rather than address health disparities. The course also emphasized the importance of open communication and respectful discussion, allowing me to listen to and consider different perspectives with an open mind. Additionally, I gained insights into how race intersects with other identities, such as gender and socioeconomic status, to shape health outcomes, reinforcing the need for culturally competent care. These lessons have fostered a socially conscious and ethical approach to addressing systemic inequities in science and healthcare."

Her emphasis on open dialogue encouraged students to share diverse perspectives, which enriched our understanding of complex topics related to race and genomics. One of the most impactful components of the course was the discussions where we shared our personal experiences and thoughts in a respectful, open space. These conversations allowed us to learn from one another and connect course material to real-life contexts, deepening our understanding of the social implications of genomics. The use of case studies and real-world examples also made the material more relatable and demonstrated the real-life consequences of the issues we studied. For future years, I would recommend keeping these interactive discussions, as they were instrumental in facilitating meaningful learning and fostering a supportive classroom community."
