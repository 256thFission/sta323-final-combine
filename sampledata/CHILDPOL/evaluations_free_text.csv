However, I don't think a decent portion of the class was actually doing any of the readings which hurt the quality of class discussion and dialogue. A way I have seen other professors address this issue is through implementing a short quiz at the beginning of each class. The quizzes don't have to court for a large portion of the grade and some can be dropped, but this approach helped ensure that students would give the readings a more thorough reading without adding a huge stressor that brings down the class mood. I also think there could be a little more focus on understanding the different political approaches of different child and family policy debates. In other classes, I have been assigned to represent a certain viewpoint on an issue, even if it is not the view I hold. This can help to understand why these issues are so hard to solve in our current climate."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I thought the structure of this course was very well thought out. From, exploring policies from a child’s chronological perspective to the media review pairings I found that the structure made it very easy to understand how and why Child Development research is important. Specifically, understanding how trauma affects young children will be influential to me later throughout life as well as understanding how race compounds nearly every issue we face.
Overall, I think the single most important take away is that there is not enough common understanding and sympathy towards what children need to succeed. I have learned the government should be doing much much more whether its through Universal Pre-school education, educational vouchers, or racially sensitive policies. In general, we truly do fall behind other nations in so many respects."

Professor Rosanbalm treats each lecture like a presentation and uses lots of visuals and stories that are helpful. The book assigned for the class was also intellectually stimulating and I learned skills and strategies that will be applicable in other courses and in the future."

The classes that covered these topics were incredibly stimulating and created an exciting and insightful learning environment. While I understand the course objectives related to success with our client presentations, I wish the classes on presentation and communications best practices had been spent on more child policy-focused content instead."
