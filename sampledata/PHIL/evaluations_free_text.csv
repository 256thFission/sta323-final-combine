Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The instructors did a great job of combining teaching with class discussions and this made the class environment very stimulating. Assigning readings before every class was helpful because it gave everyone time to read the primary sources and make their own assessments of them, then learn about what Babcock and McShea took away from them. Usually they don't align and you feel a little silly about your journal response. Journal responses are a good way to keep people honest about their readings. I'd keep the exam structure too for the most part."

For example, I appreciate the pragmatism of Stoicism (I think of myself as stoic to an extent), but some things to me are not indifferents, they're simply bad. I prefer Confucianism's focus on ritual in dealing with loss.3. I've learnt to appreciate writing more. We did a lot of writing in this class, particularly with the jounral entries and the many notes and questions we did in class.

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class.

I also appreciated how we talked about examples from our own lives and connected them to ethics. It truly made it so we could discus the challenges to living an ethical life and how to get around them to do just that.

These were the best classes because I was able to learn from my peer's perspectives, and bounce off the ideas of others. I would keep this kind of instruction, and also all of the articles from that specific website were much more digestible and interesting."

I also like how the instructor left us with questions to think about at the end of each class, and then we come back next class with our answers to the question to discuss. The way we were given the opportunity to think and come up with thought-provoking answers instead of feeling pressure to just answer immedaitely was a great way of learning how to answer philosophical questions."

I felt bored sometimes listening to classmates discuss things that didn't feel very connected to the themes of the class or readings. Also, our class discussions consisted of the same handful of people that participated constantly, and it would have been nice to see more encouragement for others to participate. To make it more intellectually stimulating, I would have preferred to have more theoretical discussions, rather than discussions over specific aspects of our Duke experiences that may not be universal."

I had to reflect deep within myself and consider how I am as a person and how I interact with the world. Professor Summers proposed thought-provoking questions and ultimatums in class that really made me rack my brain.

Dr. Summers pushes you to approach ethical topics that you may have faced several times throughout your life in a new light and from different, challenging perspectives. He makes you question simple things that we take for granted or mindlessly do in our lives, and I appreciated how receptive he is to our feedback. He truly cares about his students, and he tries to prioritize the students' personal reflection and growth over the actual grading system to the best of his ability, which I think adds to the class's environment."

I think it encouraged me to engage more with the course as well as feel like I was working towards an understanding of the material that was equivalent to a final exam. Additionally, I think having a printed response every day helped me engage in the course readings on a level I might not have otherwise, without feeling like excessive work. I often really enjoyed the prompts."

I'm a computer science major and never really got exposure to natural sciences as a whole and this class was a perfect way to be able to get that exposure. It was amazing to be able to touch on so many things such as physics, biology, computer science even from a perspective of philosophical inquiry and relating it to religion.

I was really forced to understand the concepts underlying some of the most important questions that we as humans face, such as the reliability of our cognitive faculties. The essay prompts broke down these concepts and I'm definitely going to be breaking down complicated concepts in a similar way that the professor did for future difficult essays. 
2. Understanding of neuroscience -- I'm not a neuroscience major and so I had no prior knowledge on how the brain worked at all. Getting to hold a human brain in my own hands was really special and I thought that the level of information that we could get was varied enough that a neuroscience major would learn something and a newbie like me could as well. 
3. One of my biggest insights into the class was being truly captivated by my fellow Duke peers' intellect. Many of us came from different majors and backgrounds and every person added such an interest take to the conversations. I was truly impressed with the depth of knowledge and philosophical thinking of my peers."

I truly enjoyed learning about the intersections between science and religion, in a way that held space for all opinions, faiths, and backgrounds. I didn't feel like one faith or perspective was pressed onto us, and I learned how to dive into my thoughts and mind and truly decide where I stood on issues. I learned how complex conversations surrounding evolution truly are through the different evolutionary theories-- I did not realize how much of evolutionary theory was not agreed upon, because in high school it seemed like Darwinian- natural selection was the main and agreed upon definition of evolution. Also, I have never taken a philosophy class before, and I am so glad I took this one, because I learned about various ancient philosophers, how to contrast their ideas, and specifically learned about their ideas of the mind and God, which I find fascinating as a Neuroscience student. Finally, we went to Prof. Len White's brain lab, and I had so much fun going in the context of this course. Looking at the biological brain, but harboring these deep questions about religion and what it means to be human in the back of my mind from our readings, was truly remarkable."

I feel I was better able to listen to my peers' ideas and respond to their questions. I learned a lot of names of my classmates, which I don't feel is normally the case, and it was fun. Also, Prof. Watkins always held office hours, and doing so showed be that he was very determined to provide us students support, even if that meant taking away his personal work time. I could tell that when a guest speaker came (this is a part of the class I enjoyed-- the diverse and high number of intelligent and renowned guest speakers), Prof. Watkins was genuinely excited for US to get to interact with them."

I liked his structure with a reading assignment (and sometimes a very short reading response) and then a class discussion on the reading. But these were very low-stakes and unstressful conversations where he had a set of discussion questions and prompts ready to promote conversation and debate. Professor Watkins did a wonderful job keeping the class engaged and interested in the material with several guest lecturers and class visits. We even got to go to Dr. White's brain lab in DIBS!

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","QUESTION ONE:
1. Engaging Lectures: Both the instructor's dynamic lectures and his incorporation of incredible guest lectures combined clear explanations of scientific concepts with thought-provoking questions that encouraged deeper exploration, in a non-conventional lecture format.
Discussion-Based Learning: The emphasis on open discussion allowed students to express diverse viewpoints and refine their arguments collaboratively. After each comment, the instructor maintained the ideal balance between validating his students' beliefs, further fostering an environment in which communication is valid, and also challenging them, asking follow-up questions intended with gauging their depth of analysis.
QUESTION TWO (Components to Retain):
1. Interdisciplinary Readings: Including a blend of neuroscience papers, religious texts, and philosophical essays was invaluable for a holistic learning experience. I will most definitely be re-reading my favorites of the one's he provided, like Lucretius and Plantinga. Not a single reading was short of exceedingly awe-provoking.
Interactive Class Discussions: These fostered a sense of intellectual curiosity among students, compelling me to take the class' complex commentary on the workings of the world with me everywhere I go as I continue to grapple with pressing inquiries, like the pursuit for meaning and the epistemological explanation for existence."

It made me realize how empiricism is another school of thought, and our current world might be biased towards it. But there is something undeniably visceral about the human experience, that cannot be explained by science, at least not right now, and so there must be room for some higher power... this is a kind of conversation we would have in class!

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The conflict between ideological loyalty and material harm prevention—whether in the regulation of AI-generated disinformation or in the defense of capitalist market structures—reveal the same pattern repeats: ideology-first positions prioritize abstract principles even when faced with clear evidence of harm, while material-first positions seek to address concrete damage, even at the cost of ideological purity. This essay will show how this underlying dynamic shapes both debates over AI regulation and the longstanding capitalism versus communism controversy.In the current debates surrounding AI regulation, especially around deepfake imagery and disinformation, the divide is sharp. Anti-regulation advocates adopt an ideology-first stance, prioritizing principles of free speech absolutism and market autonomy. Organizations like the Cato Institute frame any attempt to regulate AI content as a slippery slope to censorship or dangerous government overreach. Similarly, the narrative that ""innovation must be free from interference"" dismisses the material harms caused by AI disinformation — such as manipulated election outcomes, voter suppression, and the erosion of public trust. The underlying ideological commitment to liberty and free market operation remains firm even in the face of mounting evidence that AI technologies, left unchecked, can profoundly destabilize democratic institutions.Conversely, pro-regulation advocates adopt a material-first position, focusing not on preserving ideological purity, but on minimizing measurable harm. They prioritize policies like mandatory watermarking of AI-generated media, platform accountability for disinformation campaigns, and transparency requirements for algorithmic content distribution. Their arguments are grounded in concrete evidence: AI models have exacerbated biases in hiring, deepened misinformation flows, and enabled new forms of exploitation and surveillance. Rather than focusing on deontological arguments about abstract rights, material-first proponents insist that preventing real-world damage must take precedence, even if it entails some limitations on absolute free expression or market freedom.This structure mirrors the capitalism versus communism debate throughout the twentieth century. Capitalist apologetics frequently operated from an ideology-first perspective, framing free markets and competition as ""natural"" forces immune to political critique. Ideologies of meritocracy — that wealth and success reflect personal virtue — mystified systemic inequalities, obscuring the exploitation and structural violence embedded in global capitalism. Even as ecological collapse, labor precarity, and extreme wealth gaps became more visible, defenders of market ideology dismissed these harms as ""externalities"" rather than evidence of fundamental flaws. Their loyalty remained not to empirical outcomes but to the abstract sanctity of market competition.On the other side, critiques of capitalism — including socialist and communist thought — adopt a material-first approach. These critiques prioritize harm reduction: alleviating poverty, protecting ecological systems, ensuring workers' rights, and reducing systemic inequality. They are less concerned with preserving the ideological purity of economic ""freedom"" and more concerned with minimizing the tangible suffering produced by capitalist systems. Whether through labor protections, wealth redistribution, or environmental regulation, material-first critiques demand that abstract ideals yield when faced with material devastation."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","In the traditional model of ideological control, elites dominate mental production by distributing first-order ideological content: direct messages about what is true, good, or desirable. However, this is no longer the only — or even the primary — mechanism. In the contemporary world, not only does mental production distribute first-order ideology, but also the enforcement of second-order ideology additionally distributes first-order ideology. Seemingly neutral frameworks like ""free speech,"" ""anti-misinformation,"" and ""anti-hate speech"" are second-order ideologies that not only prescribe how the media should distribute first-order content but universalize first-order values through their enforcement. Thus, the public inherits first-order ideologies not only from the media itself but derive them from universal prescriptions of what kinds of communication are deemed legitimate.Consider ""misinformation"" enforcement. During the Cold War, elites not only flooded the media with anti-communist messages; they also framed sympathy toward communism itself as ""misinformation"" or ""subversion."" Thus, communism being bad was not only simply conveyed through the arguments the media made, but through ruling the discussion of alternatives as inherently illegitimate and a form of misinformation. In this context, ""misinformation"" as a second-order ideology was a direct extension of a first-order ideological battle: capitalism versus communism.In today's technocratic context, however, ""misinformation"" serves a different second-order function. The contemporary enforcement of ""misinformation"" on the surface seems to be a simple second-order filter for accuracy. However, such a filter spreads a universalist belief in objective truth — the idea that there exists a singular, recognizable reality that must be protected and disseminated for the sake of social cohesion and progress. Through this enforcement, public life becomes organized around a metaphysics of universal objectivity, where being properly informed is valued above all else.The antithesis of this is free speech absolutism. Media and education have long glorified individual liberty, often portraying censorship as synonymous with tyranny. The enforcement of free speech absolutism — treating any regulation of speech as dangerous — quietly installs this ideological lesson as a universal framework: that freedom is valued above all else, even at the expense of others' feelings, social cohesion, or truth itself. In this framework, we value our freedom over information integrity, emotional safety, and democratic stability, perpetuating the first-order libertarian ideal without openly stating it.Similarly, anti-hate speech policies reveal how second-order frameworks distribute first-order ideology. Modern pluralistic societies emphasize the protection of marginalized groups, and content celebrating diversity and inclusion is everywhere. The enforcement of ""anti-hate"" regulations carries this deep implication: that emotional harm and subjective feelings deserve institutional protection. Thus, anti-hate enforcement teaches that our feelings should be valued — that emotional safety is not merely a private concern, but a political and communicative standard that reshapes the public sphere.In each case, second-order enforcement distributes first-order ideology by naturalizing its assumptions about legitimacy, safety, harm, and truth. What appears as neutral procedural management — combating misinformation, protecting speech, ensuring emotional safety — is in fact the continuation of elite interests by other means. Thus, mental production is no longer simply about distributing beliefs; it is about embedding frameworks that structure the conditions of belief themselves. Today's ideological domination operates not only on the level of what we think, but even more profoundly on what kind of relationship to truth, harm, and freedom we are allowed to have."

- The asking for questions and then incorporating answers into lecture was a pedagogical masterclass. Generally, the pedagogical decisions seemed well-reasoned in what seemed like a difficult classroom (various backgrounds and interests).
- I feel like my analytic rigor in reading philosophic text has been strengthened, in a strictly logical sense, a historicist sense, and on the level of the form of the argument."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Wow. Learned a lot. We started with a pretty fundamental overview of the history behind the philosophy of mind. We started with Descartes, the father of modern philosophy, and moved on from there. Our book, Minds and Computers, concluded with computational theory of mind, which argues that if humans are machines, the brain is basically the hardware and the mind is the software. However, Searle showed us that computationalism can't answer intentionality (formal programs can't constitute understanding), so we have tried to find other theories that may work to explain the mind. Between Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Brentano, Dennet, Hagel, we have come to realize the importance of subjective experience in the world. So far, I really like the embodied mind theory and its appeal to naturalism."

Due to the smaller size of a seminar, me and my classmates share a deeper bond than most other classes. Doctor Pickford sometimes allow us to debate freely and only joins in to interrupt to guide us towards the crux of the problem. I'd love to have these free discussions in a class with classmates and I really this component of the class. Also, many discussions after the course with the professor is also very helpful and fun."

And all of this knowledge was achieved through reading prominent, classic literature that we were able to learn how to interpret and interact with in order to gain philosophical insights from them. It was very interesting how each philosopher's circumstances drove their thinking, and how that thinking was able to be built upon and developed over time throughout many more eras and philosophers. And it was all about arguably the most important question one can ask themselves: what is the meaning of life? I was able to learn more about philosophers who thought there is an inherent meaning to life and what that meaning looked like to them, that there is not meaning to life, or that certain factors/experiences/mindsets could give one meaning."

There are a lot of texts, most of them difficult to get through and at a fast pace at that. There are also essays to write, and they are great opportunities to better understand the texts and improve your own writing.

Being able to stop and think about one's meaning and place in the world is probably something everyone thinks about at some point in their life, so exploring how others have thought of this question is not only helpful for one's own search, but also helps to establish a new way of thinking. I think that this class helped me immensely with this. The class is a lot of reading as you read a book a week, but all for good reason. If you can manage the amount reading and can spend time on it, it will allow you to make more out of the class and be able to make more connections and develop your own ideas.

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Throughout this course I have learned how to logically read philosophy essays in order to determine what the writer is trying to say. The biggest advice I feel that the professor gave me was that philosophy is like a math logic problem, but in writing. This course has been focused on what makes a sound argument theism, the difference between deduction and induction, the mind vs. brain, the applications of AI and free will. I have learned to not take anything at face value, rather it is important to make sure every part of an argument is sound."

For each lesson we read an article, answered a question and then learned about that article in class. The lecture that the professor gave went very well with the slides he put on the board, so if I missed he said, I was able to find it on the board and take notes. I think having the paper assignments every month or so was also helpful. It was a way to reflect on the material we learned and to tie it all together.

Professor Rosenberg lectures in a way that is informative and focused but also conversational. Lectures stay focused on topic and provide deep rich detail in a clear manner, and successfully avoids wasting time on poor explanations or repeating information. Lectures are highly informative and imaginative and engaging thanks to Rosenberg, but he also keeps them conversational where anyone can raise their hand with an objection or question that he will address perfectly. All classes and all information should be taught like this.Essays and weekly assignments are also done extremely well. Optional attendance is also an extremely positive factor."

How To Teach For Learning as opposed to grades *** This was oddly actually an unintentionally interesting part of the class. The layout changing every day somehow actually lead to extremely interesting conclusions on the proper way to organize a classroom. I know it wasn't actually a part of the course, but somehow it added to the whole thing. Kinda funny** Absolute masterclass by Prof. Eva on how to get students interested by expressing his sincere interest in the topic. I never felt he was like trying to have us memorize some stuff and grade us on it. Incredible stuff. If I every wanted to be a teacher, I would set as a goal to try and make my students feel as interested as he made us all feel. A group of us ran into each other at a KA Darty and we ended up having like a 2 hour discussion on the course material totally unprompted because he made us feel so interested and invested, without trying it feeling forced at all. Incredible job, and I hope he realizes it."

I think that working with other people this way was helpful to break down some of the readings that had difficult or dense language, and it also prompted sharing of different viewpoints. 
 
I also think the short writing assignments should be kept, as they prompt the student to think about the readings beyond what was discussed in class and come up with their own ideas. 
At the end the instructor allowed us to pick two ""choice"" awards, which I liked and I think this component should be kept. I would also keep the debate, as it both forced you to look deeper into the material and also develop logic and argument skills at the same time."

This is the smallest class I have taken at Duke, and I was a little nervous that classes might contain a lot of awkward silences. Although there were a few of them, Ms.Duke made sure to engage the class with different questions, and would make sure to rephrase the question if there was any small confusion. She would often cold-call to make sure people understood where we were within our readings, and even if the student did not completely understand, would make sure to assist the student in finding a section within our readings that would help the student understand it better. Overall, Ms.Duke acted as a facilitator to our learning, making sure to provide more than enough time to answer questions and discuss more complex topics."

In other words, my thought process for what I should or shouldn't do has been affected by this class and it has taught me how to make decisions. The way I think has been altered by the topics we've talked about in this class, for example how many spoons you can take from Trinity Cafe. I never would have thought about this before this class, but I feel it has made me a better person. Another thing I learned in this class is how to prioritize different things in my life. Through all of the readings and discussions in class a major theme was what to prioritize. I feel that after all of this, my understanding of the priorities in my life has been made a lot better.

In the way that he speaks about the readings and his active choice to get students' input on each and every aspect of the class it is so clear that he would never just randomly assign a reading or assignment. I very much so respect his deliberate choices that show care and a forward thinking in his teaching style.

I also like how the instructor left us with questions to think about at the end of each class, and then we come back next class with our answers to the question to discuss. The way we were given the opportunity to think and come up with thought-provoking answers instead of feeling pressure to just answer immedaitely was a great way of learning how to answer philosophical questions."

It brought a lot of ethical theories more down to Earth and I don't think I have ever had a class on any philosophical theory where we learned things in such a tangible way where we used our own experiences to help us learn.

I had to reflect deep within myself and consider how I am as a person and how I interact with the world. Professor Summers proposed thought-provoking questions and ultimatums in class that really made me rack my brain. I always think about the values and lessons I've learned in this class outside of class, which proves how intellectually stimulating it was."

I took several ethics classes in high school, but you can take this class with no ethics experience at all. Dr. Summers pushes you to approach ethical topics that you may have faced several times throughout your life in a new light and from different, challenging perspectives. He makes you question simple things that we take for granted or mindlessly do in our lives, and I appreciated how receptive he is to our feedback. He truly cares about his students, and he tries to prioritize the students' personal reflection and growth over the actual grading system to the best of his ability, which I think adds to the class's environment."

I think she sometimes has a bit of difficulty explaining herself sometimes, but this content is very abstract and inherently difficult to explain. Even the textbook did a bit of a poor job explaining itself (which Yuan did not require), so it's less the instructor and more the content.Thankfully, though the topic is tricky, the class does not at all go deep. It's all very superficial and thus easy to grasp, so I wouldn't worry. Does not need much time out of class once you find your rhythm."

Though there's literally no math at all, its basically a math class. Like imagine just learning algebra again, or even a very very low level coding course.My one tip is to be okay with taking things for granted/as a given. You won't fully understand why we're doing something, but its not necessary to at all to do well. We're trying to translate english into a ""math"" per se, but english is obviously a language that isn't ""consistent"" for lack of a better word, so you don't realize what you're really saying when you say something. (e.g. ""If you cut the red wire, then the bomb will explode"" is not the same as ""The bomb will explode only if you cut the red wire"". The first means ""If R, then B"" and the second means ""If B, then R""). You'll learn why that is, which will be weird and very abstract, but there's no reason to care or remember why that is. You just need to remember ""B only if R"" means ""If B then R' and take that for granted/memorize it.Once you accept that, the class gets very easy."

Nonetheless if you like math, thinking critically and working with numbers this class is very interesting. Make sure to pay attention and take notes during lecture as this will really help with homeworks. Also be confident to ask questions as it will help."

I believe it deserves a QS code and a more thorough description, because it was more math than I realized. For some, it was more math than they had ever done at Duke.

This course is suitable as an introduction if you've never taken philosophy before and assumes no prior knowledge.

It is CRITICAL to attend office hours regardless of if you understand the lecture material. If you bring questions (even if they aren't directly about lectures) to office hours, your grades will significantly improve. I can't tell if this is because the instructors like when you engage above and beyond with the course and reward you with higher grades or if office hours genuinely improved the quality of my papers, but after I started attending my essay grades when from B- to A+."

By requiring us to write about what we read and by requiring participation, I was explaining some of these abstract concepts which was difficult to start with.

It gave me so much insight into how to think about things like science, neuroscience, biology from not only a scientific perspective but also a perspective that is focused on questioning the nature of these things. I'm a computer science major and never really got exposure to natural sciences as a whole and this class was a perfect way to be able to get that exposure. It was amazing to be able to touch on so many things such as physics, biology, computer science even from a perspective of philosophical inquiry and relating it to religion. It really gave me the skills and tools to be able to question my own views not only about science but about everything I do and really get to the bottom of whatever I'm learning or thinking about."

I was really forced to understand the concepts underlying some of the most important questions that we as humans face, such as the reliability of our cognitive faculties. The essay prompts broke down these concepts and I'm definitely going to be breaking down complicated concepts in a similar way that the professor did for future difficult essays. 
2. Understanding of neuroscience -- I'm not a neuroscience major and so I had no prior knowledge on how the brain worked at all. Getting to hold a human brain in my own hands was really special and I thought that the level of information that we could get was varied enough that a neuroscience major would learn something and a newbie like me could as well. 
3. One of my biggest insights into the class was being truly captivated by my fellow Duke peers' intellect. Many of us came from different majors and backgrounds and every person added such an interest take to the conversations. I was truly impressed with the depth of knowledge and philosophical thinking of my peers."

I had to ask for an extension once because of personal circumstances and he was very supportive. He's also very available outside of class for any questions and I always felt adequately supportive in my learning process.

I truly enjoyed learning about the intersections between science and religion, in a way that held space for all opinions, faiths, and backgrounds. I didn't feel like one faith or perspective was pressed onto us, and I learned how to dive into my thoughts and mind and truly decide where I stood on issues. I learned how complex conversations surrounding evolution truly are through the different evolutionary theories-- I did not realize how much of evolutionary theory was not agreed upon, because in high school it seemed like Darwinian- natural selection was the main and agreed upon definition of evolution. Also, I have never taken a philosophy class before, and I am so glad I took this one, because I learned about various ancient philosophers, how to contrast their ideas, and specifically learned about their ideas of the mind and God, which I find fascinating as a Neuroscience student. Finally, we went to Prof. Len White's brain lab, and I had so much fun going in the context of this course. Looking at the biological brain, but harboring these deep questions about religion and what it means to be human in the back of my mind from our readings, was truly remarkable."

But these were very low-stakes and unstressful conversations where he had a set of discussion questions and prompts ready to promote conversation and debate.

1. Engaging Lectures: Both the instructor's dynamic lectures and his incorporation of incredible guest lectures combined clear explanations of scientific concepts with thought-provoking questions that encouraged deeper exploration, in a non-conventional lecture format.
Discussion-Based Learning: The emphasis on open discussion allowed students to express diverse viewpoints and refine their arguments collaboratively. After each comment, the instructor maintained the ideal balance between validating his students' beliefs, further fostering an environment in which communication is valid, and also challenging them, asking follow-up questions intended with gauging their depth of analysis.
QUESTION TWO (Components to Retain):
1. Interdisciplinary Readings: Including a blend of neuroscience papers, religious texts, and philosophical essays was invaluable for a holistic learning experience. I will most definitely be re-reading my favorites of the one's he provided, like Lucretius and Plantinga. Not a single reading was short of exceedingly awe-provoking.
Interactive Class Discussions: These fostered a sense of intellectual curiosity among students, compelling me to take the class' complex commentary on the workings of the world with me everywhere I go as I continue to grapple with pressing inquiries, like the pursuit for meaning and the epistemological explanation for existence."

It made me realize how empiricism is another school of thought, and our current world might be biased towards it. But there is something undeniably visceral about the human experience, that cannot be explained by science, at least not right now, and so there must be room for some higher power... this is a kind of conversation we would have in class!

They're all very interesting and offer valuable insight on how to approach different aspects of the good life.2. I've learnt to pick and choose more effectively. The seven different traditions and religions offer important lessons on different aspects of life. I agree with some, and disagree with others. For example, I appreciate the pragmatism of Stoicism (I think of myself as stoic to an extent), but some things to me are not indifferents, they're simply bad. I prefer Confucianism's focus on ritual in dealing with loss.3. I've learnt to appreciate writing more. We did a lot of writing in this class, particularly with the jounral entries and the many notes and questions we did in class. It's brought back a lesson I learnt from my old writing teaching: ""writing is thinking"". I've done a lot of thinking through writing in this class."

As well as the use of multimedia elements such as videos, documentaries, and interactive simulations to supplement traditional lectures and field trips to religious sites or events, allowing students to experience and observe religious practices firsthand."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

The readings were incredible & helped me reframe the way I thought about how I approached life. Guest speaker conversations (with dinner), especially the one focused on the Israel-Hamas War, really helped me ground reflection into the way I approached politics—it made me realize that religion can't really exist independently of politics, which changed the way I thought about political engagement."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. I worked on my philosophical writing skills. Professor Hazelwood frequently laments the inaccessibility/pretentiousness of philosophical writing, so by constantly reading examples of good and bad prose or and argumentation, as well as writing our own philosophical papers, I left the class with a better understanding of how to write effective and readable philosophy papers.
2. I developed my argumentation skills. With two in-class debates worked into the curriculum, we had a chance to put our ideas to the test against our fellow students. This was a great exercise in research, argument preparation, and effective delivery of complex ideas. 
3. As an applied ethics course, this class helped bridge the gap between what we learn in classrooms and how we live outside school. The ""Living Ethically"" semester-long project, as well as the content of many of the readings, helped to demonstrate the link between philosophy and praxis and pushed me to reflect harder on my everyday habits."

Professor Hazelwood changed the reading quiz structure at the midpoint of the semester in response to student feedback and I think the final structure was very effective. I liked the reading quizzes because as long as you did the reading, it'll be easy, but if you didn't, you'll do poorly, so I found them to be fair and manageable, but by including an option for annotations in lieu of a quiz this was very accommodating to students who do the readings but may just not be great test-takers. I loved the debates, they were fun. The living ethically assignment was a great way to tie class concepts to the outside world, which is kind of the whole point of the class so that was great too. Podcast was a cool chance to discuss class concepts further with a real expert in the field. Honestly every part of the class was great and felt like it had a very intentional reason for being included in the curriculum."

The learning environment was very welcoming. As someone who has never taken a philosophy class at Duke, I was worried that I would struggle to grasp the concepts and fall behind, but Caleb was a great teacher who explained the concepts well and made this class an enjoyable experience for me. I like that the class had a lot of different types of assignments, like the vlog assignment and the podcast assignment, that kept it interesting and pushed the boundaries of what I usually do in classes."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I think that the quizzes at the beginning of each class were very valuable in making sure that everyone understood the material and came to class prepared to talk. I have been in a lot of classes where nobody actually does the reading, and the class ends up being the professor lecturing at the classroom, with very little room for actual deep and thoughtful discussion. The concept of having a quiz at the beginning of class is scary, and was at times stressful, but it did ensure that class ran very smoothly and was full of actual thoughtful conversation, as opposed to simply being a recap of the text."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Hazelwood's teaching style, while strong from the start, wonderfully adapted to the needs and culture of the class, greatly enhancing our ability to engage with and consume content. For example, Professor Hazelwood would provide reading assessments to determine our engagement with written material prior to class. After receiving feedback requesting a different form of assessment more accessible for those who may have testing anxiety (or anything else other than their understanding of the reading that would limit their ability to perform will on the quizzes), Professor Hazelwood immediately provided an option that allowed thorough annotations of the text to stand in for the reading assessments. I would love for the annotating option to be available in the future, and I found having both the quiz and annotation options to be very beneficial to my learning.Additionally, Professor Hazelwood's classroom management was perhaps the greatest asset for my learning. He expertly guided discussion, providing helpful information and direction where needed. I truly felt that my classmates and I were learning from each other and working towards 'the answers' (as much as there are in philosophy), and there was always a sense of accomplishment when we realized we had 'gotten' a point. Professor Hazelwood was excellent at affirming our viewpoints (or constructively and kindly pointing us in a different direction). The discussion based classroom, particularly due to Professor Hazelwood's involvement, really helped me to retain content, as it ensured that all of the students logically work through readings, rather than being handed a point or simply memorizing an argument structure."

It was the epitome of intellectual exploration because sometimes we'd get on a tangentially related topic that everyone found interesting and we'd just see it through and keep discussing it even if it wasn't on the agenda, which meant we got to cover not just the assigned readings but all the different ideas students had that were sparked by the readings."

It was extremely refreshing to hear about new content, particularly from a variety of perspectives. Professor Hazelwood did an excellent job of curating our readings such that each week we often had papers 'for' the topic at hand and other papers 'against' which enabled us to engage with each other and have productive disagreements. I really appreciated hearing both sides of various debates, and it made class discussion much more intellectually stimulating. The content covered was challenging, but not beyond our capabilities, which also made the class more engaging. I also feel that Professor Hazelwood's personality contributed to students' engagement in the course. While serious when necessary, his warm demeanor and humor was excellent at drawing students in to participate and feel confident in presenting their viewpoints. While in the past I have been terrified of 'cold calling', on the somewhat rare occasion Professor Hazelwood used it, I felt empowered (rather than anxious) to share my answer or even admit my lack of understanding on a specific aspect of a topic. Professor Hazelwood did a great job of bringing everyone into the conversation and validating viewpoints, and very quickly our class time turned into free-flowing discussions where nearly everyone thoughtfully engaged several times."

I don't think that I have felt as close to a group of students and professor as I have in this class.

Personally, it was the coveted class of the semester that I really looked forward to attending. While there are a couple of group projects, I felt the work required for them wasn't stressful. Professor Hazelwood is a very fair grader, provides quality feedback to support his grading decisions, and is also willing to provide extra credit opportunities. It's definitely a class where the work you put in directly results in your grade, so as long as you do your assignments with good effort, you should do well in the course.

There are a lot of texts, most of them difficult to get through and at a fast pace at that. There are also essays to write, and they are great opportunities to better understand the texts and improve your own writing.

Being able to stop and think about one's meaning and place in the world is probably something everyone thinks about at some point in their life, so exploring how others have thought of this question is not only helpful for one's own search, but also helps to establish a new way of thinking. I think that this class helped me immensely with this. The class is a lot of reading as you read a book a week, but all for good reason. If you can manage the amount reading and can spend time on it, it will allow you to make more out of the class and be able to make more connections and develop your own ideas. The grading is pretty vague, but seems to be mostly participation based along with three papers throughout the semester."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","The conflict between ideological loyalty and material harm prevention—whether in the regulation of AI-generated disinformation or in the defense of capitalist market structures—reveal the same pattern repeats: ideology-first positions prioritize abstract principles even when faced with clear evidence of harm, while material-first positions seek to address concrete damage, even at the cost of ideological purity. This essay will show how this underlying dynamic shapes both debates over AI regulation and the longstanding capitalism versus communism controversy.In the current debates surrounding AI regulation, especially around deepfake imagery and disinformation, the divide is sharp. Anti-regulation advocates adopt an ideology-first stance, prioritizing principles of free speech absolutism and market autonomy. Organizations like the Cato Institute frame any attempt to regulate AI content as a slippery slope to censorship or dangerous government overreach. Similarly, the narrative that ""innovation must be free from interference"" dismisses the material harms caused by AI disinformation — such as manipulated election outcomes, voter suppression, and the erosion of public trust. The underlying ideological commitment to liberty and free market operation remains firm even in the face of mounting evidence that AI technologies, left unchecked, can profoundly destabilize democratic institutions.Conversely, pro-regulation advocates adopt a material-first position, focusing not on preserving ideological purity, but on minimizing measurable harm. They prioritize policies like mandatory watermarking of AI-generated media, platform accountability for disinformation campaigns, and transparency requirements for algorithmic content distribution. Their arguments are grounded in concrete evidence: AI models have exacerbated biases in hiring, deepened misinformation flows, and enabled new forms of exploitation and surveillance. Rather than focusing on deontological arguments about abstract rights, material-first proponents insist that preventing real-world damage must take precedence, even if it entails some limitations on absolute free expression or market freedom.This structure mirrors the capitalism versus communism debate throughout the twentieth century. Capitalist apologetics frequently operated from an ideology-first perspective, framing free markets and competition as ""natural"" forces immune to political critique. Ideologies of meritocracy — that wealth and success reflect personal virtue — mystified systemic inequalities, obscuring the exploitation and structural violence embedded in global capitalism. Even as ecological collapse, labor precarity, and extreme wealth gaps became more visible, defenders of market ideology dismissed these harms as ""externalities"" rather than evidence of fundamental flaws. Their loyalty remained not to empirical outcomes but to the abstract sanctity of market competition.On the other side, critiques of capitalism — including socialist and communist thought — adopt a material-first approach. These critiques prioritize harm reduction: alleviating poverty, protecting ecological systems, ensuring workers' rights, and reducing systemic inequality. They are less concerned with preserving the ideological purity of economic ""freedom"" and more concerned with minimizing the tangible suffering produced by capitalist systems. Whether through labor protections, wealth redistribution, or environmental regulation, material-first critiques demand that abstract ideals yield when faced with material devastation."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","In the traditional model of ideological control, elites dominate mental production by distributing first-order ideological content: direct messages about what is true, good, or desirable. However, this is no longer the only — or even the primary — mechanism. In the contemporary world, not only does mental production distribute first-order ideology, but also the enforcement of second-order ideology additionally distributes first-order ideology. Seemingly neutral frameworks like ""free speech,"" ""anti-misinformation,"" and ""anti-hate speech"" are second-order ideologies that not only prescribe how the media should distribute first-order content but universalize first-order values through their enforcement. Thus, the public inherits first-order ideologies not only from the media itself but derive them from universal prescriptions of what kinds of communication are deemed legitimate.Consider ""misinformation"" enforcement. During the Cold War, elites not only flooded the media with anti-communist messages; they also framed sympathy toward communism itself as ""misinformation"" or ""subversion."" Thus, communism being bad was not only simply conveyed through the arguments the media made, but through ruling the discussion of alternatives as inherently illegitimate and a form of misinformation. In this context, ""misinformation"" as a second-order ideology was a direct extension of a first-order ideological battle: capitalism versus communism.In today's technocratic context, however, ""misinformation"" serves a different second-order function. The contemporary enforcement of ""misinformation"" on the surface seems to be a simple second-order filter for accuracy. However, such a filter spreads a universalist belief in objective truth — the idea that there exists a singular, recognizable reality that must be protected and disseminated for the sake of social cohesion and progress. Through this enforcement, public life becomes organized around a metaphysics of universal objectivity, where being properly informed is valued above all else.The antithesis of this is free speech absolutism. Media and education have long glorified individual liberty, often portraying censorship as synonymous with tyranny. The enforcement of free speech absolutism — treating any regulation of speech as dangerous — quietly installs this ideological lesson as a universal framework: that freedom is valued above all else, even at the expense of others' feelings, social cohesion, or truth itself. In this framework, we value our freedom over information integrity, emotional safety, and democratic stability, perpetuating the first-order libertarian ideal without openly stating it.Similarly, anti-hate speech policies reveal how second-order frameworks distribute first-order ideology. Modern pluralistic societies emphasize the protection of marginalized groups, and content celebrating diversity and inclusion is everywhere. The enforcement of ""anti-hate"" regulations carries this deep implication: that emotional harm and subjective feelings deserve institutional protection. Thus, anti-hate enforcement teaches that our feelings should be valued — that emotional safety is not merely a private concern, but a political and communicative standard that reshapes the public sphere.In each case, second-order enforcement distributes first-order ideology by naturalizing its assumptions about legitimacy, safety, harm, and truth. What appears as neutral procedural management — combating misinformation, protecting speech, ensuring emotional safety — is in fact the continuation of elite interests by other means. Thus, mental production is no longer simply about distributing beliefs; it is about embedding frameworks that structure the conditions of belief themselves. Today's ideological domination operates not only on the level of what we think, but even more profoundly on what kind of relationship to truth, harm, and freedom we are allowed to have."

Many of the papers we read build upon topics that are covered in introductory bio courses (201/202), but they give us a lot of the philosophical and biological grounding that we do not get exposure to. I would say this course also develops communication. In this class, we have been encouraged to speak in an open and inviting environment. Our class atmosphere is light and fun, and with that, comes an ability to dive more deeply into content and not jump over any confusions. The third would be critical thinking.

There was also a reading comprehension quiz at the start of each class. Although this wasn't my favorite thing, it did incentivize me to read more carefully.

I think spending more time teaching the foundation would have been beneficial than just going through readings every class because sometimes the readings were dense and difficult to understand leading to disengagement. I appreciate the change that Caleb made halfway through the semester to have less quizzes, but at the same time, I think the amount of reading we had to do per class was a little too much."

However I feel that the way Caleb ran the class and how knowledgeable he is about the subject allowed us to understand and discuss the topics at hand.

The readings and discussions were super interesting. As stated before, classes led by the instructor were very engaging, classes led by students did not reach the same depth of discussion."

From the papers we read, to in-class discussions, to class activities, and projects, the class allows for a lot of room to engage with the material. It was seen from our final Kahoot—the class clearly retained many of the main ideas (as well as specific details) of a number of the topics and specific readings we covered. I would also posit that the final project (a research paper) is a very wonderful way to draw together some of the ideas and skills we developed throughout the semester. Initially, I had an idea for a paper. Then, Caleb pointed me towards some readings that he thought would be helpful. As I read more and more literature, I reworked my thesis and came up with an entirely new project proposal and ran with that! In speaking with Caleb to revise, I was able to readjust my lenses once again. He provides a wonderful opportunity to learn and really delve into what scientific writing and understanding is."

As someone who enjoys biology and philosophy separately, I disliked nearly every reading and element of this course. The grading was harsh, and I left this class not wanting to take another class in these fields."

I wish that I had dropped it and it ended up being way too much work for a biology/philosophy elective class. The topic is also not even close to being ethical debates about things like CRISPR or other biology concepts. The topics are much more about semantics in biology and are pretty useless when considering real applications in biology.

I think if you have a good understanding of philosophical concepts or some sort of baseline that would be helpful for this course. I appreciate how willing Caleb is to meet with students and making the class environment fun, but I believe you should take this course if you truly are interested in Philosophy of Biology because then you would get the most out of it.

Discussions are great and accessible to anyone, regardless of background. At times, the course seemed to apply more meaningfully to biology than philosophy, so it's worth having at least a basic curiosity about the former."

This course, especially for an elective, is difficult. It requires attention to reading, active participation in class, and in my opinion, a genuine interest in the topics covered. Readings are dense and you are quizzed on specific points in each. The projects are time intensive, and while Caleb is understanding, it requires a good amount of time out of class."

The reading and assignments helped me to better formulate questions and research lines of inquiry when engaging with the field, specifically when it came to questions of epistemological groundings of biological research. Moreover, his writing assignments helped me hone my writing style when it comes to papers within the context of scientific and philosophical journals and how one should go about formulating logical and structural components of arguments in this context. I learned how to think critically as a philosopher of biology would when it comes to either established scientific theory and practice or its new emerging forms and questions."

You can clearly tell he has a deep love and knowledge of the subject matter and shared this with the students in a way that also got them engaged and excited about these questions. He used various engaging assignment styles, such as debates, group discussions, and journal style writing to expose us to the broader practice of academic philosophy. His specific teaching style is one that simultaneously embraces the interests of students while also pushing them to follow their thinking to its conclusions and even go beyond it. Specifically, I think his assignment in which we had to interview a current biologist was one of the most stimulating and rewarding discussions I've had with a professor during my time at university and something I think certainly should continue in the future of his courses."

It would be even better if you tried to work ahead a little bit. The grading was very critical, which is on one hand very frustrating, but also rewarding as it does build a better sense of thinking and writing. For those who think it would be more biology-leaning, it is philosophy-heavy with the topic being biology, so don't take it if that is what you're looking for. Overall, a decent course that definitely challenges you to think in different ways, especially if you're constantly taking STEM courses, but it can feel very rough (especially during the summer)."

Note that this is not a feminist philosophy class, more so a class about women philosophers. I think these are philosophers that are underrated in the academic canon, although Beauvoir is quite popular now. But definitely Simone Weil is an underrated writer and philosopher that everyone should read. Professor Moi is also a great teacher who understands students and the texts quite well. The amount of texts you read in this class is perfect. Long enough that you get a deep enough understanding of the philosopher, but also not too long so that it becomes unmanageable. The texts are also enlightening and perfectly difficult to understand so when you do get some insight it feels nice and illuminating."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this class we had discussions of very politically controversial topics every week - I think that one main thing I learned from this teaching style was how to apply different frames of thought to the same issue. More specifically, we applied economic, political, and philosophical analysis to each topic that we reviewed during the course. So I learned to integrate different frameworks into one broader idea / topic. I also learned about different philosophies / approaches to life - for example the difference between egoism and altruism and how these two perspectives influence individuals' way of thinking about different phenomenon. Also, I particularly enjoyed when Professor Salsman opened up abvout his personal research and models on the financial economy and his financial crash predicting model - the finance discussion was particularly interesting to me."

I think this made the class WAY more interesting, because it was the first class with a truly open discussion I have ever attended. I think universities and Duke in particular needs to work on not allowing professors to penalize students for their political opinions, and they should ask Salsman how to do this, because he did a fantastic job at moderating and encouraging discussion of diverse perspectives."

I wouldn't change much.The weekly assignments are painful (providing an attempt at a strong argument often is), but I find them to be incredibly useful tools for my development as a writer/philosopher.  It is the process of writing, being forced to find and form an argument about each reading, rather than the product or even the comments from profs, that is the most useful in this regard.One thing I might consider is allowing 1 skipped writing per semester.

That there should be limited exposition or lecturing from profs and students should lead the discussion.  Profs Jhun and Stern did an excellent job giving students the ability to lead this course while providing clarifications ad counterbalancing opinions where necessary.  I wouldn't change much.The weekly assignments are painful (providing an attempt at a strong argument often is), but I find them to be incredibly useful tools for my development as a writer/philosopher.  It is the process of writing, being forced to find and form an argument about each reading, rather than the product or even the comments from profs, that is the most useful in this regard.One thing I might consider is allowing 1 skipped writing per semester.  It gives students the ability to be flexible when schedules require (or to just take a break for a week)."

The writing components were very helpful for getting us to develop the skill of reading a lot and responding substantially fairly quickly, but given that these were done before any class discussions made them sometimes feel a bit pointless as a way to help us /understand/ the readings better (e.g. there was at least one week where I wrote a response and we spent the whole class talking about things that essentially nullified my response by answering lower-level questions that I had incorrectly assumed answers to)."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Wow. Learned a lot. We started with a pretty fundamental overview of the history behind the philosophy of mind. We started with Descartes, the father of modern philosophy, and moved on from there. Our book, Minds and Computers, concluded with computational theory of mind, which argues that if humans are machines, the brain is basically the hardware and the mind is the software. However, Searle showed us that computationalism can't answer intentionality (formal programs can't constitute understanding), so we have tried to find other theories that may work to explain the mind. Between Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Brentano, Dennet, Hagel, we have come to realize the importance of subjective experience in the world. So far, I really like the embodied mind theory and its appeal to naturalism."

More specifically, we applied economic, political, and philosophical analysis to each topic that we reviewed during the course. So I learned to integrate different frameworks into one broader idea / topic. I also learned about different philosophies / approaches to life - for example the difference between egoism and altruism and how these two perspectives influence individuals' way of thinking about different phenomenon. Also, I particularly enjoyed when Professor Salsman opened up abvout his personal research and models on the financial economy and his financial crash predicting model - the finance discussion was particularly interesting to me."

I think this made the class WAY more interesting, because it was the first class with a truly open discussion I have ever attended. I think universities and Duke in particular needs to work on not allowing professors to penalize students for their political opinions, and they should ask Salsman how to do this, because he did a fantastic job at moderating and encouraging discussion of diverse perspectives."
