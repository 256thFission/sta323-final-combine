The quizzes are genuinely not that bad (part 1: they will read three sentences and you type them up, part 2: they will read two questions and you type up your answers, part 3: unscramble two sentences that are shown on the board), but you should definitely make sure you know the grammar very well before the tests (a lot of us end up using the full class period). You also need to talk enough in class to get full participation points, but I was on the quieter side and still ended up getting 9.5/10 for the participation + attendance, so take that as you will.

Keep on top of your quizzes and preview assignments, and you should be well prepared for everything else. Study your vocab incrementally and don't wait to cram right before the exam, which might let you scrape by, but will not help you actually retain the vocabulary or grammar.
Zhang Laoshi is an excellent instructor. She's very personable and engaging, and she's also very understanding. If you're having difficulties, please reach out to her, as she wants her students to succeed, and will do her best to assist you. The Chinese department in general is wonderful. I have nothing but positive things to say about the program and faculty!
(I mentioned above that my engagement with the course was moderate. This isn't by any fault of the course or instructor. This semester has just been a bit tough for me for unrelated reasons.)"

Also, I was never told when we had an essay or when an essay was due, so it was hard to know when an essay was due. Essaying grading is also weird. Essay grading isn't based on whether a sentence is grammatically correct, but whether the course TA believes the word is the most formal. The problem with this is that what the TA thinks is formal is not the same as what students think is formal because everyone's approach to writing Chinese depends on regions of China they grow up in. In many ways, this grading system is discriminatory against non-heritage speakers, along with heritage speakers who grow up in other areas of China."

Most native speakers who test into this class are qualified to get an A- or A, but this course is significantly harder for non-native speakers just due to the amount of vocabulary and writing they are expected to complete each class. I felt that the workload is generally ok, but I spent significantly more time when essays or review tests were coming up. I would also say that you are expected to participate a decent amount each class given the small class size - if you are not willing to voice your opinion or have a discussion on societal issues, I would reconsider."

Firstly, I've noticed a substantial improvement in my Chinese writing skills. The course's focus on integrating learning about Chinese mythologies and traditional stories into our writing exercises not only enhanced my language proficiency but also deepened my engagement with the material.Secondly, the class illuminated aspects of Chinese culture and history that were entirely new to me. Although I consider myself to be fairly knowledgable about Chinese culture, the class nevertheless significantly broadened my horizon of cultural perception and introduced complex ideas and historical contexts that I had not encountered before, fostering a greater appreciation for the nuances of Chinese cultural heritage. Alongside this, the development of my critical thinking skills was particularly emphasized, teaching me to analyze and interpret historical and cultural information critically and thoughtfully.Lastly, the course challenged me to view Chinese history and culture through a new lens. This approach was incredibly enriching and eye-opening, as it allowed me to see the diversity and depth of Chinese mythologies and history in ways I had not previously considered. Using both an academic lens and a colloquial lens consisting of films, multimedia, and stories, Professor Jiang offered an incredibly engaging, thought provoking class and  facilitated incredibly rigorous in-class discussions and debates of the influences shaping modern China and mythologies. Overall, this course has not only bolstered my language skills but also profoundly expanded my cultural knowledge and analytical abilities, making it a truly invaluable educational journey."

Her deep knowledge, patience, and caring nature created a supportive and encouraging classroom atmosphere. Dr. Jiang's personalized approach to giving feedback on our individual assignments and presentation styles was particularly invaluable. This not only helped improve my language skills but also boosted my confidence in public speaking and academic writing in Chinese.Furthermore, Dr. Jiang's innovative use of creative writing assignments and in-class debates greatly enhanced my engagement with the course material. These methods allowed us to explore Chinese mythologies in depth and from multiple perspectives, enriching our understanding and appreciation of the stories. Her ability to facilitate discussions effectively ensured that every voice was heard, fostering a dynamic and interactive learning environment. The debates and discussions prompted critical thinking and allowed us to delve deeper into complex cultural concepts, making each class session both challenging and rewarding.I would strongly advocate for the continuation of these interactive components in future courses. The creative writing assignments encourage creative expression and deeper cultural immersion, while the in-class debates enhance critical thinking and engagement. Dr. Jiang’s discussion facilitation style not only makes the material more accessible but also more compelling, significantly contributing to a lively and inclusive classroom atmosphere.Overall, Dr. Jiang’s teaching methods are a testament to her dedication and skill as an educator, and they have profoundly impacted my studies in Chinese language and culture.

Her careful attention ensures that the course is accessible and engaging for students from diverse academic backgrounds and varying levels of Chinese proficiency. This method not only makes the material more relatable but also fosters a dynamic learning environment where students feel encouraged to participate and express their ideas.Second, the class is also stimulating for the critical thinking skills that it practices. In class, we engage a lot in exploring different sides of the course material to build our critical thinking and evaluation skills. This practice not only deepens our understanding of Chinese culture and mythologies but also enhances our overall analytical abilities. Dr. Jiang's emphasis on critical thinking prepares students to handle nuanced discussions and to approach problems with a sophisticated analytical lens."
