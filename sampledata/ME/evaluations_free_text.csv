However, amidst the struggles, I did manage to extract valuable insights, particularly from the segments that focused on mechanisms of different classical ML models and handling time series data. These sections not only added depth to my knowledge but provided an amazing learning experience. 
My pre-existing bias towards models for image analyses posed a hurdle. This is because image data analysis isn't a routine part of my work, thus comprehending the intricacies of the utility of these models proved to be a daunting task. Nonetheless, credit to David for breaking down the complexity in a way that made sense whenever some of these models generated meaningful outputs during HWs.An unexpected and positive takeaway was using Google Colab for the HWs. Despite being accustomed to Spyder for my ML analyses, Google Colab proved transformative. My proficiency in using Colab increased tremendously which simplified the completion of assignments on time. Consequently, I have since abandoned Spyder and embraced Colab for my research after appreciating its convenience. Overall, while the course presented challenges, it facilitated significant growth in my skill set by introducing me to tools and work flows that will enhance my research efficiency beyond the class requirements.

The content is not too difficult, and the tests/assessments are very reasonable as long as you understand the content. The labs are also not terribly difficult, and focus more on what happens during the lab period rather than intensive calculation/analysis after the lab session. Personally I find this setup more enjoyable than how some other classes approach labs. I would even go as far to say that the labs are actually quite fun to do. As for the lectures, Volker Blum is a very good teacher. He explains things very concisely and his lectures are interesting. As long as you don't fall behind on the course content you will probably do fine."

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire xLab project; I thought it was a great addition to the course and allowed us to utilize design skills in a course for the first time in quite a while, since most of the engineering courses after EGR 121 have been highly conceptual and are not always super clear without any physical representations present.

I think that this was very beneficial to my learning in that it taught me how to work through these problems in a strategic manner. I also really enjoyed the hands on project (xlab) that was associated with this half of the class, it gave us something physical to further develop our skills from class."

I think I definitely learned a lot more by working on one thing for a longer period of time rather than a bunch of smaller unrelated projects. I also think when seeking out help, especially Becky, she was very accessible and helpful and if I asked her to meet it was definitely super easy to find time with her and she would help. I think also doing more example questions during the second half of the course was helpful. i liked that in the first half of the course we had the fea/castiglianos in our team project which got translated into the in person aspect of the project where we had to predict failure modes. I also liked the machine shop project, as someone who had never been to the machine shop, it was a great intro to the machine shop and made it a lot more accessible."

The class felt like it was split into multiple hastily assembled parts. Not enough planning and iteration went into executing the vision the instructor had for the course. The lectures and dry and related to lab work only in the content covered. To teach this class the way that I think it was intended to be taught, I think the class lecture/lab structure will need to be abandoned in the future to introduce some sort of hybrid structure that gives students more of an opportunity to engage and complete work in class as opposed to trying to get things done during an hour of recitation at the end of the week."

I think the short homework assignments were helpful for my learning but the longer ones seemed a bit tedious comparatively. The mini-challenges were interesting but it was sometimes hard to see how they connected to the course. The quizzes were fair for the most part with Dr. Simmons, but Dr. D did not do a very good job estimating how much time it would take to complete the quizzes and had seemingly arbitrary rationale regarding is cheat sheets. The team projects and labs have potential to add a lot to this course, but they were not managed well throughout this year, leading to unnecessary student stress."

Both allowed me to learn something interesting that was engineering related, but not necessarily super technical. I thought the flash talks gave a good balance to the class and I always looked forward to hearing from my classmates. I also thought the solidworks assignments were helpful in getting a better understanding of CAD. I hadn't worked much on solidworks since freshman year so it was a nice refresher and also cool to learn how to use some of the simulation tools. In the second half, I enjoyed getting to learn how to use the 3D printers. It was cool to see the behind the scenes rather than just sending everything to the colab without really knowing what is going on. I also enjoyed taking on the role of the SD card. I liked being able to contribute to collecting the data and actually getting to analyze it for the xlab."

I often felt like I needed to learn most if not all of the material myself before quizzes. It's also important to note that much of the class was a direct repeat from EGR201 (statics) and felt like we were learning new methods for the same concepts, which felt kind of like a waste of time. I really enjoyed taking EGR121 with Prof. Simmons and I think it would be a benefit for this class to adapt itself to be more like that. Teach each important concept one at a time, and then do a clearly outlined and well fleshed out project relating to that concept and testing it out in real life.

Learning aspects of design was interesting, however the only time we got to apply our knowledge and actually design something ourselves was for a very simple beam to fit very tight constraints that didn't lead to any real innovation. Changing the xLab projects to focus on allowing the students to design components like the shaft geometry or the set up itself would be much more stimulating than being handed premade CAD files with instructions to simply hit print."

Learning objectives were not given. They were mentioned verbally but having a list that we can check our understanding with would be useful. Fewer assignments that were more focused would be preferable, even if it meant that each assignment took more effort/time."

At time, I felt like I was taking separate classes, and one had me trying to work part-time hours in the lab while the other almost bored me to death with slide after slide. A lot of engineering classes have the same problem, though, and think that force-feeding students information and having them spend enough hours in the Foundry that they get sick of being there is ""stimulating"" when it's really just exhausting."

It also is good for prepping for technical interviews for mechanical engineering jobs. However, the inconsistency and lack of good communication throughout the class definitely took away from the overall learning experience of the class."

Other portions of class such as the guest speakers that were in the first half of class were very interesting because I liked having someone that was specialized in the topic come in and speak about it.  Another way they could make it more stimulating is they remove George as a professor entirely from the class as he lacks expertise on the topic and seems unprepared and disorganized when teaching and instructing the labs."

General failure analysis is an extremely useful skill to have for such interviews, and this class does an effective job of teaching you what to look for in failure analysis (at least for static loadings).Unfortunately, there are many aspects of this class that prevented intellectual stimulation. The labs often involved troubleshooting random electronic components as opposed to challenging the understanding of course material. The final quiz gave about 10 minutes per problem in a class that often gets through maybe 1 or 2 problems per lecture. Lectures could be disorganized, and technology issues often popped up, delaying the teaching. These should be easily troubleshot beforehand such that it is not an issue in the lecture."

We never once spoke about how to design effective microcontroller systems, control dc motors, or even write a CNC-program to machine. We can take more time in lecture to analyze what is going on in our lab projects, especially afterward as a reflection, and use that time to better understand the concepts being applied in the lab."

There are some decent bones within the changes made in the middle of the semester but it has been very chaotic and unclear. It has not been a good experience. Honestly, as a Junior, I am in too deep to change majors within Pratt. But, if you're a sophomore, you probably still could with minimal issues. The MEMS department is very chaotic right now and this class is indicative of it. I would avoid being a MEMS major for the foreseeable future. And that sucks to say. Mechanical Engineering is the best major for what I want to do with my career and I wouldn't want to change it but the department has been so all over the place I'd almost consider it."

It constantly changed throughout the semester in every way including assignments, grading structure, grades themselves, content, and labs. The best way to stay on top of the class was to have constant communication with the professors and make an effort to be candid about when the workload was becoming too much. The assignments in the first half were way too many at once and hard to keep track. In the second half, the projects were consolidated however felt less applicable to mechanical engineering. Good luck!"

He seems very out of touch with his students concerns, does not communicate well (which is ironic since this is something that he harps on in class), assigns an abundance of work without realizing how long it is going to take, and doesn't teach very well in class. On the other hand, Dr. Simmons side of the class was much more enjoyable. While it was tedious at points, her general empathy towards students and the relationships that she builds went a long way. Lastly, I would say to utilize the textbook for this class, as it is a very helpful tool."

When I took it, they overhauled the curriculum about halfway through in a frantic and unorganized manner. I hope the curriculum is more organized for you, but be ready to have to reach out consistently to determine what is required to receive good lab scores.

I thought that the homework, though long and sometimes difficult, were good practice of in class principles and allowing for the development of skills and problem solving that was instrumental to my success on the quizzes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire xLab project; I thought it was a great addition to the course and allowed us to utilize design skills in a course for the first time in quite a while, since most of the engineering courses after EGR 121 have been highly conceptual and are not always super clear without any physical representations present. I think that while it could be improved in a couple ways, the xLab was a fantastic project, and I think it should absolutely be kept for future years."

For the first half of the semester, I enjoyed being able to learn about FEA and CFD, and I also really enjoyed the Exploration Assignments which filled an ethical void I think a lot of engineering courses have. I also sincerely appreciated learning how to use the Machine Shop, and wish this was introduced earlier in the curriculum. However, many of the assignments during the first half of the course felt unrelated or even sometimes like busy work. In the second half of the course, I felt that was fixed. It no longer felt like busy work, and our very consistent project was very interesting. I loved how each lab built on each other. I would definitely keep the XLab component."

She taught us the material and walked us through practical examples to help use deepen our understanding. Dr. D's portion of the course felt much more lecture style and less helpful. I found that while we covered a wider breadth of material, I understood all of it less. It felt like Dr. D was more attempting to hit a checklist of topics rather than ensuring we understood what he was teaching. The homeworks, while of similarly difficulty to the homeworks assigned by Becky, took significantly longer to complete because I felt I had to teach myself all the material. There was a strong disconnect between the material taught in class and the expectations of homework. Often we weren't taught that material necessary to even begin understanding the homework until the same day the homework was due. Overall, the timing and material of the second half of the class was lacking."

I think also doing more example questions during the second half of the course was helpful. i liked that in the first half of the course we had the fea/castiglianos in our team project which got translated into the in person aspect of the project where we had to predict failure modes.

The class felt like it was split into multiple hastily assembled parts. Not enough planning and iteration went into executing the vision the instructor had for the course. The lectures and dry and related to lab work only in the content covered. To teach this class the way that I think it was intended to be taught, I think the class lecture/lab structure will need to be abandoned in the future to introduce some sort of hybrid structure that gives students more of an opportunity to engage and complete work in class as opposed to trying to get things done during an hour of recitation at the end of the week."

I think the short homework assignments were helpful for my learning but the longer ones seemed a bit tedious comparatively. The mini-challenges were interesting but it was sometimes hard to see how they connected to the course. The quizzes were fair for the most part with Dr. Simmons, but Dr. D did not do a very good job estimating how much time it would take to complete the quizzes and had seemingly arbitrary rationale regarding is cheat sheets. The team projects and labs have potential to add a lot to this course, but they were not managed well throughout this year, leading to unnecessary student stress."

I thought the flash talks gave a good balance to the class and I always looked forward to hearing from my classmates. I also thought the solidworks assignments were helpful in getting a better understanding of CAD. I hadn't worked much on solidworks since freshman year so it was a nice refresher and also cool to learn how to use some of the simulation tools. In the second half, I enjoyed getting to learn how to use the 3D printers. It was cool to see the behind the scenes rather than just sending everything to the colab without really knowing what is going on. I also enjoyed taking on the role of the SD card.

I really enjoyed taking EGR121 with Prof. Simmons and I think it would be a benefit for this class to adapt itself to be more like that. Teach each important concept one at a time, and then do a clearly outlined and well fleshed out project relating to that concept and testing it out in real life.

At time, I felt like I was taking separate classes, and one had me trying to work part-time hours in the lab while the other almost bored me to death with slide after slide. A lot of engineering classes have the same problem, though, and think that force-feeding students information and having them spend enough hours in the Foundry that they get sick of being there is ""stimulating"" when it's really just exhausting."

Other portions of class such as the guest speakers that were in the first half of class were very interesting because I liked having someone that was specialized in the topic come in and speak about it.  Another way they could make it more stimulating is they remove George as a professor entirely from the class as he lacks expertise on the topic and seems unprepared and disorganized when teaching and instructing the labs."

General failure analysis is an extremely useful skill to have for such interviews, and this class does an effective job of teaching you what to look for in failure analysis (at least for static loadings).Unfortunately, there are many aspects of this class that prevented intellectual stimulation. The labs often involved troubleshooting random electronic components as opposed to challenging the understanding of course material. The final quiz gave about 10 minutes per problem in a class that often gets through maybe 1 or 2 problems per lecture. Lectures could be disorganized, and technology issues often popped up, delaying the teaching. These should be easily troubleshot beforehand such that it is not an issue in the lecture."

There are some decent bones within the changes made in the middle of the semester but it has been very chaotic and unclear. It has not been a good experience. Honestly, as a Junior, I am in too deep to change majors within Pratt. But, if you're a sophomore, you probably still could with minimal issues. The MEMS department is very chaotic right now and this class is indicative of it. I would avoid being a MEMS major for the foreseeable future. And that sucks to say.

It constantly changed throughout the semester in every way including assignments, grading structure, grades themselves, content, and labs. The best way to stay on top of the class was to have constant communication with the professors and make an effort to be candid about when the workload was becoming too much. The assignments in the first half were way too many at once and hard to keep track. In the second half, the projects were consolidated however felt less applicable to mechanical engineering. Good luck!"

He seems very out of touch with his students concerns, does not communicate well (which is ironic since this is something that he harps on in class), assigns an abundance of work without realizing how long it is going to take, and doesn't teach very well in class. On the other hand, Dr. Simmons side of the class was much more enjoyable. While it was tedious at points, her general empathy towards students and the relationships that she builds went a long way. Lastly, I would say to utilize the textbook for this class, as it is a very helpful tool."

Labs were not very intellectually stimulating, however, because student involvement in data collection is minimal. The only thing students really do is write the report, which is just more of the theoretical calculations we do in class already. But I understand there is limited lab equipment so it is hard to work around this. Definitely keep the review sessions, and releasing the review handouts beforehand has been intellectually stimulating, as students ca discuss the questions and try them before seeing the answers."

However, lecture is not enough to understand the concepts or problems you might see in the homework, and the textbook contains a lot of information that is unnecessary to know. That being said, students taking this course should expect to rely on practice problems given either in class, for homework, or for review sessions in order to learn what needs to be known for the exam(s). Labs do not usually contribute to much additional understanding other than getting to see the equipment that creates the cycles."

At the same time, Professor Chen is very bright and will answer your questions to the best of his abilities. He has been teaching graduate students previously and probably finds it difficult to dumb it down to an undergraduate level. I think the lecture style with printing out the slides then annotating on them is a good idea. I can tell that he puts in the effort to teach the course and he WANTS us to learn. He's not some sick professor who wants to torture us. Tests are fair and I like that there is only one midterm. I also like the closed + open book test format."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Chen in no way facilitated learning in his classroom. Instead, he confused his students. He attempted to teach material, often going on long-winded side tangents mid-class. He spent more time computing basic calculus, showing derivations of the mathematical equations, than analyzing the fluids principles and content we were trying to learn. The material he did present often contained inaccuracies. After class, we often received emails with corrections to the lecture slides and materials to correct mistakes he told us in class. For example, for our second lab, he failed to teach us the material needed to complete the theoretical analysis and to understand the purpose of the lab until the day the lab was due. He then sent out an email after that day's class noting that his explanation and the information in class and in the lab manual was wrong and the entire premise of the lab was invalid. He sent out a new resource page before noting that a single day extension should be enough time to redo the entire lab. Overall, I felt that this class was more of a complete content self-study with instructor assigned homeworks and mandatory confusing lecture, than a comprehensive structured fluids education. The labs, run entirely by Pat, were helpful and felt relevant to the concepts we were supposed to be learning in class."

I would definitely encourage keeping the method of asking students when office hours would be most useful so that everyone has time to attend. During office hours early on in the semester, the professor asked myself and a few other students what he could do to improve students' understanding of material. We communicated that the most effective way we learn is by applying theory to tangible examples and practice problems, however his response was ""there isn't enough to do problems when I have so much theory to get through."" I feel as though this is not an effective method of teaching and does not focus on what is important - the students being able to learn information. Learning the conceptual theories is very important, however refusing to show students how to apply it sets them up for failure in every other situation for their engineering careers. We would spend very long hours attempting homework and struggling to understand him in office hours because none of us were ever able to grasp quite how to apply his concepts to real world applications. I would love to put theory into practice, but it needs guidance."

I think the homeworks were mostly helpful, although it was often hard to tell if problems were done correctly. The demos and the lab related to the class well, but the instructions from the professor were not very clear and led to a lot of confusion. Lecture slides were very helpful, but I found reviewing them on my own more beneficial to my learning then when the professor talked over them in lecture."

It might not be the most entertaining class I have taken, but I feel that I have learned something from taking this course (compared to, for example, ME 321, which is just a repeat of EGR 201 and filled with busy work).

Also often Prof. Chen would teach material he would explain to us was not important and would not be tested on yet rush over very key and very foundational concepts. He rarely if ever gave examples in lecture, telling us that if we wanted to see example we had to come to his 2 office hours a week which were, for many students, during some of their other classes or at inconvenient times. Even if students were able to make it to the office hours, he would often gloss over examples and not explain them in a clear manner. Finally, the labs often felt irrelevant and didn't feel like they related to lecture, and if they did were many many weeks ahead of or behind the relevant concepts. Note that Pat McGuire did a great job in making the labs as clear as possible, often having to teach us the material that we should have learned in lecture."

Read the textbook if you do not understand the class and do the homework problems. Ask the professor your questions after class and he will gladly help you. He is a serious person and may seem scary to approach but he puts in so much effort to answer questions. From the fact that he changes office hours to accommodate more students joining them and explaining important concepts repeatedly, he wants us to learn.

After taking this course you will 100% design better parts This course is great for the following reasons:1. Excellent interview preparation course; many of the topics are asked about in all mechanical engineering interviews
2. Having a ""intuition"" (deep understanding) about the stiffness of structures makes you a better engineer and designer. Knowing when, where, and how to add stiffener ribs or parts is a critical part of being a mechanical engineer. Coupled with the emphasis of material properties, this is the quickest way to become a better mechanical engineer. 
3. The homework assignments force you to get hands on with structure's stiffnesses (3d printing of frames, trusses etc.) this is an excellent way to develop a feel for designing and analyzing larger structures."

Even though there was a large amount of content to work through, Scovazzi still made time for questions and would break down the concepts on the whiteboard whenever a student had trouble putting together the importance of different equations or principles. The homeworks were also very well designed, flowing into one another very well and helping to demonstrate the cumulative learnings of the class extremely well."

However, amidst the struggles, I did manage to extract valuable insights, particularly from the segments that focused on mechanisms of different classical ML models and handling time series data. These sections not only added depth to my knowledge but provided an amazing learning experience. 
My pre-existing bias towards models for image analyses posed a hurdle. This is because image data analysis isn't a routine part of my work, thus comprehending the intricacies of the utility of these models proved to be a daunting task. Nonetheless, credit to David for breaking down the complexity in a way that made sense whenever some of these models generated meaningful outputs during HWs.An unexpected and positive takeaway was using Google Colab for the HWs. Despite being accustomed to Spyder for my ML analyses, Google Colab proved transformative. My proficiency in using Colab increased tremendously which simplified the completion of assignments on time. Consequently, I have since abandoned Spyder and embraced Colab for my research after appreciating its convenience. Overall, while the course presented challenges, it facilitated significant growth in my skill set by introducing me to tools and work flows that will enhance my research efficiency beyond the class requirements.

You will really dive deep into the mathematical proofs, and while this can be confusing it really helps develop and deeper appreciation what is ""under the hood"" and the pros and cons of the methods. However, you do work on coding these algorithms in the homework which helps you understand the parts of them. There is a final project which allows you to really push your understanding to the limits, and really focus on a semi-real world application. Professor Aquino is a great professor and I would 100% take this class again."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Understanding how robots “grasp” the world
One of the biggest takeaways for me was learning how robots physically interact with objects especially how they grasp and manipulate them. Concepts like force closure and wrench spaces helped me see grasping not just as a mechanical action but as a balance of forces and geometry. It gave me a new appreciation for how complex even a “simple” task like picking something up can be for a robot.2. Bridging control theory with real-world behavior
I also learned how to connect the dots between control theory and real robotic actions. Working with impedance control and hybrid force/position control showed me how robots can be made to behave more naturally and safely, especially in dynamic or unpredictable environments. It shifted my thinking from purely theoretical to more application-oriented problem-solving.3. Planning in the face of uncertainty
Lastly, I really valued learning about planning under uncertainty. Techniques like sampling-based planning and optimization-based trajectories helped me think more algorithmically and realistically about how robots navigate complex spaces. It taught me that robotics is as much about smart decision-making as it is about mechanics or electronics."

I especially appreciated how theoretical lectures were balanced with practical examples and real-world applications, which helped me understand not just the what, but the why behind each concept.One of the most helpful components was the mix of coding assignments and conceptual problem sets. This combination allowed me to both implement algorithms hands-on and reflect on the deeper reasoning behind them. The coding projects, in particular, really pushed me to connect theory with practice, which made the learning feel more complete.I also found the open-ended discussions during office hours and in class sessions really valuable. They encouraged us to think critically and ask questions beyond the syllabus, fostering a collaborative learning space. If I were to suggest components to keep for future years, I’d definitely say the balance between theory and hands-on application, the clarity of lecture pacing, and the instructor’s openness to questions and exploration were standout aspects worth continuing."

The concepts we covered like grasp planning, motion control, and planning under uncertainty weren’t just presented as equations or algorithms, but as tools to solve real, complex problems in robotics. That made every lecture feel meaningful and intellectually rewarding.The assignments and discussions encouraged me to think beyond the textbook to ask why certain approaches work, how they could be improved, and where they’re used in real-world robotic systems. I especially appreciated the emphasis on connecting mathematical models with physical intuition, which helped deepen my critical thinking.If anything were to make it even more stimulating, perhaps occasional guest lectures from researchers or industry professionals could add new perspectives and show how these ideas are actively shaping the field.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this course, I learned that cavitation bubble collapse plays a critical role in stone fragmentation during Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy. While photothermal ablation has traditionally been considered the primary mechanism, recent studies show that toroidal bubble collapse near the stone surface generates intensified shock waves that contribute significantly to stone damage. This understanding was supported by high-speed imaging and hydrophone measurements that revealed distinct damage patterns and optimal standoff distances for efficient energy delivery.I also developed the ability to identify key acoustic features associated with damage-inducing cavitation events. These include peak pressure, rise time, pulse width, and the number and timing of shock wave emissions. Such features help distinguish between effective and ineffective bubble collapses, enabling more accurate monitoring of laser-stone interactions. Recognizing these parameters is essential for linking acoustic signals directly to stone damage.Lastly, I gained insights into applying sound recognition and machine learning techniques to classify cavitation signals. Feature extraction methods and spectrogram analysis were adapted to analyze acoustic emissions from bubble collapse. Classifiers such as support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and neural networks were used to categorize signals based on their potential to cause damage, paving the way for automated feedback systems during laser lithotripsy procedures."
