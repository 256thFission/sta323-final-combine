Please describe three specific things you learned.","I learned the basics of psychological research, an area I had no exposure too, specifically becoming aware of what makes a research study credible, valid, and impactful. I also learned that much of an individual's life is shaped by early childhood experiences, and that antisocial behavior development can have its strongest roots in early childhood. The final most transformative perspective I gained insight to is the injustices of our criminal justice system that perpetually disadvantages certain minority groups, and leaves individuals worse off than before. Overall, the course renewed my passion for justice reform and child policy."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The learning environment in this class was stellar. Lectures were well organized and clear, carefully scaffolding concepts so that we were able to understand not only how, but why each approach was to be used. Assignment struck the right balance of being calibrated to our current knowledge level while stretching our skills in each technique in a way that made each assignment time well spent. Labs and assignments were formatted in a way that promoted being able to get the support we needed and build our expertise in R as well. The feedback we got every week on assignments was amazing, and critical for us to be able to learn regression at a level that we will be able to actually use it in our research. The grading approach strongly supplemented this quality feedback emphasis."

Madeline's method of having us upload corrected versions of our assignments to the system encouraged a more efficient learning environment. This approach allowed us to learn from our mistakes without fear, promoting a deeper understanding and mastery of the material. This method of iterative learning and feedback should definitely be continued to enhance intellectual stimulation for future classes."
