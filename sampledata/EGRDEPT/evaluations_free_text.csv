Please describe three specific things you learned.","A lot of what I learned was from phases of the engineering design process.
For one, I learned several different methods to brainstorm ideas. I don't remember the formal name, but one involved dividing our solution into parts, and then all members going in a circle for several minutes thinking of any possible idea for that part. This was a much more systematic way to brainstorm than what I was originally thinking, and there was a big emphasis on being outlandish with ideas. In fact, one of the ideas that I initially thought was unrealistic and not worth considering, solenoid valves, became our final solution.I also learned how to put these ideas together and rank the resulting solution combinations through a Pugh matrix. Again, coming in, my approach would have just been to look at each and every solution qualitatively and see which one ""made the most sense,"" but this was a much more systematic, objective, evidence-based way to identify a solution that best met our design criteria.Finally, I also learned to write technical memos, including the overall style of formal, informative writing, the format (top-down, most-important findings to then specifics), the kind of information to include, etc."

The next 7-ish weeks are dedicated to hands-on work and prototyping your solution. The class very much has a ""figure it out"" mentality, which I do think is a fairly good representation of what engineering is. I felt like I was able to learn a lot of skills because I was forced just to try things.

I feel like if we were allowed to start working on some low-fidelity/medium fidelity prototypes earlier, perhaps still during the brainstorming process, it would make understanding the problem better and would lessen the stress near the end of the semester.

This was also shown in all the written assignments- it felt like we were just appealing to the opinion of our professor instead of creating a technical memo based on our project and goals."

This is something new for most of us so it was intellectually stimulating in many different ways, such as learning how to communicate thoughts and ideas in a professional ways, brainstorming design ideas, learning different skills. 
- The way it could be improved would be to make sure that the projects were all ,at least of, a similar level. I believe some teams would have profited more out of this class if their project was one that included more complex engineering skills. The project is a very important part of this class, thus I feel like the more alike projects are in their complexity, the more equal the experience of each student group will be."

I enhanced my team working/collaboration skills and ability to utilize the tools properly in the POD. One specific item I learned throughout this course was how to crimp wires. Another item I learned in this course is how to organize and create a professional poster for a project. Finally, I learned how to understand how to put together and use a solar panel. Although these items are specific and a bit random, the process of learning all of these items was insightful and have prompted me to succeed in future Duke classes."

2. I learned a lot about how to code an app and circuits thanks to my teammates and the nature of our project.
3. I learned that you always have to expect something to go wrong even if you feel like your idea is foolproof, and it is important to always be ready to accommodate for these potential issues."
