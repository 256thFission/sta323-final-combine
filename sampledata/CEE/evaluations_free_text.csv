Indeed, bar, beam, and frame systems are all analyzed using the same methodology, with slight variations. If a student is confused with the bar system, they most certainly will be confused with the beam system. If a student is confused with the beam system, they most certainly will be confused with the frame system.

Dr.Katul was very open to everyone asking lots of questions which made the classroom environment very conducive to my learning style. I also appreciated when Dr.Katul began to use the chalkboard more than reading off of slides as he found it was better for this class. Using the chalkboard for derivations and examples helped content understanding significantly. He also wasn't afraid to rexplain concepts in a different way if it wasn't understood the first time.

Additionally, it would be helpful to have context about the successes and failings of water resource engineering in the past. Not just dam breaks but how dams affect the ecosystem. The instructor referenced the fact that lots of dams are being decommissioned currently but there was no mention of the opposition to dams, the history of levee failure in the US, or other context to disputed methods of water resources. It feels important that engineers are educated about the past so that they do not blindly repeat previous historical mistakes. This is particularly important in this course because of the self-worsening issue of flooding that has been perpetuated in the past by poor engineering choices."

Specifically learning about habitat restoration potential and how to direct the flow of water amongst desertification was incredible.

Another aspect of the course that facilitated my learning was the homework. I liked the coding-based homeworks since having to implement the concepts we learned in class in MATLAB code was a great test of my understanding and helped me learn the FEM better.

He was very patient and willing to answer any questions we had. He also was very relatable and understood the difficulty of the course, which helped me to not feel silly for not understanding some of the material the first, second, or even third time around. I really loved his side stories that he would add in as a ""break"" from deriving equations on the board. I also appreciated that the homework was much more difficult than the exams. This definitely prepared me for the exams in the class and helped me to feel more confident. While I didn't love doing the homework, having problem sets each week kept me engaged in the material and forced me to learn and use it. The TA, Jaleesia, was very helpful as well in the learning process in this class and was always available for help. I also think having the class meet 3 times a week and that it ended a little early helped me to dedicate the time the course demanded and, in the end, I left with more knowledge gained than I was expecting."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. A major adjustment I learned how to make in this course was how to critically think and answer difficult questions in ways I had never had to before. For example, the take-home midterm was a challenge for me, because the solutions to the questions weren't intuitive and often caused me to have to go down other avenues to solve the questions that we did not explicitly go over in class. Although it can be a frustrating experience, I understand how important it is to go through that sort of challenge because things will never be as cut-and-dry in the workforce as they may be in classes.
2. Conceptually, I better understood how to connect quantitative environmental parameters (e.g. partitioning coefficients) to qualitative descriptions of how structure can impact environmental fate.
3. As someone who had not had a lot of experience with understanding chemical fate through atmospheric components, this class gave me a good foundation for understanding this field and helped me feel confident to pursue coursework in air quality engineering."

However, amidst the struggles, I did manage to extract valuable insights, particularly from the segments that focused on mechanisms of different classical ML models and handling time series data. These sections not only added depth to my knowledge but provided an amazing learning experience. 
My pre-existing bias towards models for image analyses posed a hurdle. This is because image data analysis isn't a routine part of my work, thus comprehending the intricacies of the utility of these models proved to be a daunting task. Nonetheless, credit to David for breaking down the complexity in a way that made sense whenever some of these models generated meaningful outputs during HWs.An unexpected and positive takeaway was using Google Colab for the HWs. Despite being accustomed to Spyder for my ML analyses, Google Colab proved transformative. My proficiency in using Colab increased tremendously which simplified the completion of assignments on time. Consequently, I have since abandoned Spyder and embraced Colab for my research after appreciating its convenience. Overall, while the course presented challenges, it facilitated significant growth in my skill set by introducing me to tools and work flows that will enhance my research efficiency beyond the class requirements.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Prof. Carlson is very approachable and was highly aware that the audience had minimal data science/statistics/programming background and tailored his lecturing style to accommodate this audience. Example coding sessions helped connect the dots between theoretical principles and applications but since they were given in the traditional lecture setting, it was difficult to follow along with the code and ask questions in real time. I would've preferred to use the dedicated lecture time to go deeper into topics and reserve the coding sessions for an additional session such as a lab or office hours which would be more informal and allow students to properly engage with the code and ask questions as we go through it."

I also thought the workload was appropriate - enough to make sure that we grasped the content, but not so much that it overwhelmed other responsibilities (research, etc). The homeworks and in class exercises where we actually processed sequencing data were very helpful to me.

This adaptability significantly contributed to my overall learning experience.  The lectures were efficiently structured, allocating more time to ensure the proper execution of analyses rather than focusing solely on content delivery. This deliberate emphasis on practical application and hands-on learning reflected commendable patience and commitment to facilitating our understanding of the new and challenging material introduced. I'd like to keep most of the class material since there is a vast amount of data that I am interested in analyzing independently.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. A major adjustment I learned how to make in this course was how to critically think and answer difficult questions in ways I had never had to before. For example, the take-home midterm was a challenge for me, because the solutions to the questions weren't intuitive and often caused me to have to go down other avenues to solve the questions that we did not explicitly go over in class. Although it can be a frustrating experience, I understand how important it is to go through that sort of challenge because things will never be as cut-and-dry in the workforce as they may be in classes.
2. Conceptually, I better understood how to connect quantitative environmental parameters (e.g. partitioning coefficients) to qualitative descriptions of how structure can impact environmental fate.
3. As someone who had not had a lot of experience with understanding chemical fate through atmospheric components, this class gave me a good foundation for understanding this field and helped me feel confident to pursue coursework in air quality engineering."
