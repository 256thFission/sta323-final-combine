Please describe three specific things you learned.","Learned a lot about specific Renaissance history, not only architectural but also general history, which was incredibly interesting as the background of the Renaissance is important to understand the architecture that came out of it. 
I learned how to think extra-critically about architecture, and realize how interconnected everyone involved in architectural history is. I also learned many things about the process of creating books and how printing worked. This may seem like a weird thing to take from this class, but understanding how books were made really helps with analyzing the old architectural books that we got ahold of."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I did appreciate that the slides that the professor lectured from didn't have all of the words that she was saying. This is because it is much more intriguing to hear from her rather than have her just read off a slide, which is something i can do. It makes the class more engaging and forces you to pay attention. It was also very easy to raise your hand and ask questions- most professors would ignore you if you had your hand up until they decided they were done, but in this class I could raise my hand and get my question answered immediately, which was very engaging. Additionally, one of my favorite parts was going to the library and reading books from close to the Renaissance period. It's great because it allowed me to be personally connected with the content of the course; having a physical grasp of history is absolutely fascinating."

Professor Galletti really talked TO the class rather than AT the class, which made the material a lot easier to engage with, and facilitated connections and engagement for the course material. The assigned readings were always elaborated upon and tied directly into the day's lesson, which really helped me understand them better. The trips to the library to see first-hand the materials that we were discussing in the class, such as Alberti's 1st edition publications and such, were very cool and made it much easier to remember / build upon."

If you are interested in art history, architecture, or life during the Renaissance, it is certainly a class you should take. It gives you perspective for when you see old buildings in modern times --- where the architectural elements came from, and why they were initially implemented in the designs. Now when I travel, I can see how different aspects of buildings are derived from different architects' styles and/or ancient times."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","This was a wonderful class.  The materials and syllabus were very well-laid out and thoughtful.  Laura in particular does an amazing job of keeping the class lively and interesting.  Clearly the lessons were always very thoughtfully prepared, as were the supplemental learning materials and assignments.  Expectations were always very clear.  I think honestly what made the class so helpful and fun was Laura's personality and commitment.  She is always positive and engaging while maintaining control of the class and expectations.  She was kind in meeting any time to practice (office hours or otherwise) and she was kind and supportive in instances where my schedule in particular was at odds with the syllabus and class. That made such a difference in my enjoyment and motivation to continue.  In terms of the logistics and format, honestly I thought it was all good.  I liked the asynchronous activities and the talkabroad.  The sentieri homework was very important to ensure I engaged and studied each night as well."

I don't think you can replicate the effectiveness and efficiency that our class had without someone like Professor Barbara.

I think having the various checkpoints (such as one-on-one meetings) throughout the course was very helpful, as well. Overall, having a professor who genuinely cares about their students is a baseline, but a box that Prof B checked off from the first day. You can't truly replicate her positive energy and willingness to honestly see all of her students succeed."

It also ensures that you don’t fall behind, and holds you accountable for getting better with the language. Also, the assessments were all very fair. With a reasonably small amount of outside work, I was able to get 100 on most."

I will say that there were some days that the lectures seemed a little too material heavy and would cause me to burn out.

Another thing that is leaving with me after this semester ends is the variety of food recipes. For example, how to prepare tiramisu or cannoli. Not only that but how to make pasta from scratch from the Tavola Italian event. Lastly, what I loved most learning in this class was the immigration issues in Italy. For example, I was able to understand it better through the analysis of the show Zero. But, then in our individual/group projects and research, I was able to understand how Ghali (a rapper) who is a rapper and second generation living in Italy survives the stereotypes and rising problems with the laws. I felt freedom throughout the whole course because every group project within the unit was chosen by us (like the person we wanted to do research on or theme). Moreover, I learned about what it is like working with other students while speaking italian. This was helpful practice outside of class because not only was it homework to complete, but it pushed us to stay constant of our use of italian language. I really enjoyed getting together whether it was in partners or groups to work outside of class. I enjoyed presenting and working on presentation and oral skills in the italian language. It gave me a sense of confidence."

I appreciated the printed worksheets to work during class on our own and then along with the class and him. Having google slides ready helped me a lot since I am a visual learner. I was able to understand grammatical rules by the many examples given during class and as homework. I loved how we were able to practicing our speaking skills by participating in class, it was a well ratio of the professor teaching and us practicing. I am very happy with how the class runs. The homework and assignments were well organized in order to understand especially on canvas. I like that we didn't use so much sentieri, but I thought it was needed before quizzes, which he made sure to assign. I really thought that the grading worked fantastic and was fair for everyone. The comments and feedback actually pushed me to do better and motivate me at least for presentations and writing."

It is an accelerated course so expect homework every night but I think that Laura managed to make the work interesting and entertaining. For example, for one homework assignment we had to go get gelato. There were different activities that helped keep me engaged. I also think that it's helpful to ask a lot of questions. The professor is very willing to answer and help you understand but don't wait until the big projects or a quiz to try and learn something. I would definitely recommend this and I would say that Laura does a great job of giving a general review in the beginning of the course since she knows that we all come from different levels of Italian. I hadn't taken an Italian course in a year and I felt that I caught up fairly quickly."

I argue that you will improve your Italian skills more than in many other courses. I will say that it is a lot of work 4 times a week a 3-hour class and 2 times a week a 2-hour class. Additionally, outside of class, you are expected to attend multiple required museum visits and exhibits. The grading of the classes is fair and you should get an A as long as you put in a decent amount of work. You also have a 3-day weekend where you can go travel with the group or on your own. I would recommend taking this course to fulfill the language requirement, but also if you are really interested in traveling. If you are usually the type of person that likes to have a couple of hours of relaxation time on the weekend, I would not recommend the course since we always have something to do which can be good and bad at times."

It was also very easy to raise your hand and ask questions- most professors would ignore you if you had your hand up until they decided they were done, but in this class I could raise my hand and get my question answered immediately, which was very engaging.

The midterm was mostly fair passage identification and some factual information (expecting the final to be similarly fair). The papers were actually quite fun to write because we could choose to write about any translations, parallels, and commentaries we thought were most intriguing, i.e. there was a lot of free rein. The group activities, like the in-class art project, were great. I enjoyed the guest lecturer as well."

He is not afraid to step outside orthodox boundaries to go after people he doesn't like. Dante Alighieri freely and frequently brandishes his ire against 14th century ecclesial figures and put them through heart-wrenching methods of suffering. This coupled with an acute sense of self-awareness makes it hard to hate an exiled 14th century Italian man's charisma."

We learned the distinction between modernism, post-modernism, existentialism, absurdism, communism, syndicalism, anarchism, and other ideologies in a literary context. We had the privilege of visiting the Rare Books library and picking works to analyze closely and the Nasher to look at the works of Chagall, Dali, and other relevant artists, as well as to do a compare/contrast essay on a short story and its film adaptation. These experiences allowed us to appreciate the important differences between different media: short vs. long-form fiction, final versions vs. galley proofs, film, and art.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I love the way the course was structured, both the overarching structure of different themes for different groups of stories and the day-to-day structure of reading 1-5 short stories for class, coming to class to discuss in-depth, and then writing a short paper about a handful of these stories later on. I loved the unique opportunities the class had to offer, namely the Rare Books and Nasher visits and Francesca Magario guest lecture (I loved that lecture!). I loved the variety of papers: the close reading of a Kafka short short story, Rare Books object paper, animal research paper, and film and passage comparison essay. This is also the only humanities class in which I've had an exam, but I think it made sense to include it as an assessment because it forced me to stay on top of the readings (and come to class) and not just skim them. It meant I thoroughly read each story to learn the author's style and the story's influence. Professor Z is very insightful, prepared for class, engaging, and accommodating with deadlines, and she really shines when her students reciprocate an interest in the content. I was in a class with her last semester where the students were in general less engaged, which I think limited her teaching. This time around, most of the class came having done the readings with interesting takeaways/interpretations and ready to discuss, and this meant she could offer more as a professor as well. The professor and the students, in addition to the stories we read, made this class truly one of my favorites that I have taken at Duke."

By the end of the course, you'll be able to say that you're well-versed in modern European short fiction authors like Kafka, Joyce, Woolf, Dostoevsky, Mann, Sartre, Camus, etc. You get to do some cool out-of-class excursions too, like to the Rare Books library and the Nasher. The professor is very knowledgeable, effectively facilitates class discussions, and is very accommodating with deadlines. Plus the papers are very short (max 3 pages). There is one exam where you have to match 12 or so quotes to their author/work and write about the immediate context and significance of the quote, but it is very doable if you do all the readings and come to class consistently.

Prof was very responsive to class interest and would engineer the class as time went on to react to the interests that had arisen in the class and also the wider context of life (i.e the election). This made the class engaging, relevant and interesting. Prof L was very adept at responding to varying interests and abilities of the class ranging from individuals who were very interested in the study of linguistics to those who were taking a linguistics class for the first time. There was a constant revision of key terms and concepts so no one was left behind."
