Understanding Illness as Culturally Constructed: One of the most impactful insights I gained is that illness is not just a biological event—it’s shaped by cultural beliefs, social systems, and power structures. This helped me see how different societies interpret symptoms, causes, and healing in distinct ways, which really shifted how I think about health and medicine.

I have a greater appreciation for policymakers after seeing how difficult it is to implement the most effective plan. Both professors were excellent and I feel that I can look at the world from a different (policy) lens now.

It's a really fun and insightful class, but it can also be a bit draining too.

It is also different when deeply understanding that each case has its own contributing factors. These contributing factors can make drastic differences. For example, the background history of the patient can change the starting point for recovery after spine surgery. A patient may not have much mobility before surgery, so it is not expected for much mobility advancement to happen right after surgery when compared to someone who has more mobility experience in surgery. Yet, even with more prior mobility experience, the process of surgery recovery is still a long road. Main takeaway:  It is not possible to take a cookie-cutter approach to every surgery and recovery, so to say that this set of steps/lifestyles before and after can help surgery is an outdated idea that I was impressed with. Each case is different and therefore has its own unique steps."

I loved that we were able to support that patient as a navigator. There was one visit in which we got (big huge credit to Jaqueline) to request a bed checkup for the patient. About 6-7 minutes, there was a bed checkup and it was decided to swap out the bed of the patient since it would not inflate. It was impactful to see. Also seeing how we bring conversation to the patient is something else I enjoyed participating in. It can be a little disappointing to be stuck between four hospital walls, and I think having some sort of conversation with other individuals can help make the patient better. Social support is very important, and to know that we are part of the support for this patient is a reward on its own."

I had a limited understanding of the patient experience, and an even sparser understanding of what providers and advocates are going through. The interviews I conducted and transcribed showed me how much people put at risk - in terms of their safety, livelihood, well-being, and that of those around them - to do their jobs, provide evidence based care and do right by their patients every single day. I also learned more about reproductive healthcare policy and healthcare policy more generally.

Professor Sadowski was an incredibly knowledgeable professor, but at times his lectures were a bit confusing because a phenomenon that was easy to understand for him was not so easy to understand for us.

It's a really fun and insightful class, but it can also be a bit draining too.
