However, I think this changed after the mid-semester survey that we had. As previously mentioned, Cody helped make the course more engaging by adding interactive activities like our A&R project. By forming our own K-Pop groups based on the topics we discussed in class (such as the business of building an idol group), we got to practice identifying ways that companies try to garner success/virality through the idols they select for groups and the marketing tactics they use (brand collaborations, variety shows, etc.)"

A lot of the neuroscience research that we looked at was situated in the context of languaging and musicianship."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

She was an incredibly approachable, flexible, and caring professor and created an environment where it felt like we were really able to think critically while also having fun in a low-stakes environment. The course's selected topics and the sequence in which these topics were presented were logical and coherent. I appreciated that Emily took the time to contextualize each new topic we discussed within the scope of what we had learned thus far. Topics were well-connected and referenced each other, which gave me a deeper appreciation for the course's ethnomusicological lens and each of the individual musics. Emily did a fantastic job of fostering a friendly and supportive class environment. Despite the larger class size, it felt like we were able to have discussions, share ideas, and get to know each other's ways of thinking. Emily also seemed genuinely interested in learning from us, fostering a non-hierarchical classroom environment (versus one where the professor clearly presents as the all-knowing expert uninterested in students' insights) that I think greatly encouraged students' independent thinking. Karaoke was a lot of fun and also helped build camaraderie among the class. I think all of the assignments were meaningful and useful while also leaving plenty of room for our own thinking and creativity (e.g. 3 you pick listening journals and a very open-ended final project). Course assignments were structured in a way that leaves options and appeals to a diversity of strengths and weaknesses (e.g. appealing to those who prefer test-taking vs. essay-writing and to those who prefer independent vs group work). Most of all, this class was fun! It's such a relief to have a class that is genuinely fun, where the professor is also excited to just have fun while still learning a lot."

Much of the stimulation I got was from the variety of pieces that we sang. When we sung Eric Whitacre's ""Sacred Veil"", the deep connections of this piece to our loved ones who have passed made this piece emotionally difficult yet rewarding to sing.

She does only A, B, C, and D, so if you get below a 93, that's where the B begins. Just be aware because there are only five assignments, each worth 20 points, so you can't get off more than seven points total or else you'll get a B. 
There is also a research project towards the beginning of the semester that takes a substantial amount of time. You may not be told that you have to memorize a song for the performance part of that project, but if you bring in sheet music and refer to it when you sing, you will get points off. Prepare your song as if it's an audition. In your music video project, don't deviate from your previously-submitted plan without talking to Chauntee' first, as you will get points off if your final product is different than your plan.
Chauntee' gives good feedback on singing and acting, so I enjoyed working with her overall."

Through the books we read, like Dan Heath's Upstream and Fearless Negotiating by Michael C. Donaldson, I learned how to preemptively stop problems from occurring, as well as how to negotiate and the most effective way to do so. Through our assignments, I learned how to organize and put together a calendar with important dates and events, as well as how to make a budget for both mainstage and repertory theater shows, which is a very useful skill. Knowing how to work with money and budget everything accurately is a skill important to all aspects of life."

Overall though, if you have any interest in theater or management the class is very interesting. If you have no background in theater the class does cover most of what you would need to know. The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

They were more dynamic and allowed us to incorporate a lot of skills we personally had. It gave us an organization or community to reach out to, which helped. I think tying the fieldtrips back to the concepts we learned was enlightening. This was most seen in the writing assignments, such as the discussion posts. There was a lot of critical thinking and realization that ""oh yeah, this particular institution shows a concept we highlighted in class"" or ""I did not even realize this institution probably had to mull over their economics & that this affected their policy."" I think the final paper was kind of shoved in there at the end, but I much prefer that over any final exam."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Coming into the class, I had some pretty big assumptions about the general content of the class. At first, I didn't think the course was going to center on US Latinx studies; I thought it was
going to focus on the history of Latin American countries and how those become affected by US intervention. Personally, I truly enjoy the direction the course is going. Learning about the history
of Latinos in the US, their struggles, their legacy, is a rich topic that I had previously not had the resources to understand. I've always wanted to learn more about this but I've never really had
the impetus to do so. I think it is so interesting to talk about these historical events, like the Chicano movement or the labor strikes, and tell my friends about them. It's a part of history that
goes unnoticed and it's worthy of bringing up everyone once in a while during a conversation. Outside of that, I feel like this class has made me more conscious of the continual Latino
presence in the US and what people are doing to combat injustice. I've done research and learned about powerful organizations, both in North Carolina and my hometown of Miami. It's
amazing seeing that everywhere there are communities like these all fighting for visibility and justice. I gain a lot from the music component of the course, and connect it to other music classes I've
taken at Duke. It's interesting seeing the connection between how the music we study is composed and what the music is representing. Understanding the Chicano movement through
song is a beautiful way to look at history. A song I particularly found touching was ""Urbano's song"". It was by far one of the saddest songs I've heard this year, and I still listen to it in my
 spare time.More concisely I learned:
- How to analyze Latino history and research topics in Latino studies.
- How to make a community facing project 
- How service learning can be used to supplement a class as well as engage with the surrounding community."

The instructor’s approach of using specific pieces of music to illustrate key concepts made the learning process more tangible and memorable. I particularly appreciated the open discussions, which encouraged critical thinking and allowed us to dive deeper into the music and its cultural context.

The way the course connected different jazz styles across eras and explored the innovations of musicians made me think critically about the genre’s evolution. The listening sessions and discussions encouraged active engagement, challenging me to listen more attentively and analyze the music on a deeper level.

Lecture is very substantive—I'd encourage you to take some notes and definitely write down the names of songs and artists you find interesting. I've added a lot of these songs to my playlist recently, but I hope you take it however far you want to go. Finally, this class has truly changed my understanding of jazz, especially the more subtle interdisciplinary connections between subjects like musical expression, music theory, American history, and pop culture. Taking this course has given me a much better idea of what jazz is foremost, and has also allowed me the means to appreciate the cultural and historical factors that have inspired what it's become today."

Until Professor Todd resolves these issues, I cannot recommend you take it with him, even with as much as I enjoyed his lectures and have respect for him as a musicologist. The good news is that the issues I have presented are objective and easy to fix (every other MH course does them). I am optimistic that these points may not be issues in future class sessions.That said if you must take it with him, the way to do well on the assessments is to rely heavily on a music theory analysis and tie those elements into a historical context (do not write about history and just describe how the piece makes you feel). Avoid using vague language and avoid writing your papers the day before due to allow time to find grammatical/redundancy errors. If you do these things, it should be possible to get an A-/A on every paper."

You will learn a lot about Romantic music regardless of your background and with someone who is deeply passionate about his life's work. That being said, go into the class thinking about this rather than the quantitative grade or course credits that you get out of it—Dr. Todd purposely doesn't mention these a lot, and he likes focusing on your experience in his class a lot more.

He’s a wealth of knowledge and is very amenable to students. The papers aren’t too difficult - just be sure to proofread beforehand. Utilize the music library, as there are many books down in the stacks that will help give you accurate positions on the pieces for the papers. The listening quizzes are only tough because the pieces are very long (multiple symphonies with multiple movements). Be sure to take it chunk by chunk and start very early in advance so you don’t have to stress about cramming beforehand."

Mostly just pay attention to the specific excerpts played in class, take notes on potentially what to listen for, and memorize the years (also if you start studying early it's also easier, although I did well on both just by cramming the night before and the day of the exam). Papers on the other hand are difficult and seem to be graded very heavily on clarity and conciseness of writing, use of varied word choice, and consistency of formatting, so spend some time editing your papers."

The class is comprised of singers from groups throughout Duke and even one person who conducts in band but doesn't sing otherwise. Dr. Friedman's hands on approach to the class helped each student to improve through their active participation as we are always getting in front of the group to practice our conducting. I would definitely keep this component for future years. The guest speakers he brings in offer different point of views to conducting and music making as a whole which I have found great value from.

The routine of the group singing for one person conducting was fun and helpful, as we got practice both conducting and learning large quantities of music, so I would keep that structure for future years. Furthermore, the final exam was a great culmination of everything we learned this semester, from the actual motions of conducting to planning and running a rehearsal, so I would keep the final exam component the same for future years."

It hardly ever met, there were no opportunities to test our knowledge, and there were no assignments besides the final. The professor didn't use slides or organize his lectures beyond a basic chronology from the beginning of hip-hop to the present day. Because the professor cancelled so many classes, we never made it close to the present day and finished in the 1990s. There are podcasts about hip-hop that have to be better than this. Really disappointing and a waste of a credit."

She does only A, B, C, and D, so if you get below a 93, that's where the B begins. Just be aware because there are only five assignments, each worth 20 points, so you can't get off more than seven points total or else you'll get a B. 
There is also a research project towards the beginning of the semester that takes a substantial amount of time. You may not be told that you have to memorize a song for the performance part of that project, but if you bring in sheet music and refer to it when you sing, you will get points off. Prepare your song as if it's an audition. In your music video project, don't deviate from your previously-submitted plan without talking to Chauntee' first, as you will get points off if your final product is different than your plan.
Chauntee' gives good feedback on singing and acting, so I enjoyed working with her overall."

Overall though, if you have any interest in theater or management the class is very interesting. If you have no background in theater the class does cover most of what you would need to know. The knowledge gained from the class can be applicable in areas outside of theater as well, so it is still worthwhile. The class is pretty chill and Thom is very approachable, plus you get to enjoy two comped shows, one at the DPAC with a Q&A session with the cast and crew after, and another with the Duke Theater Studies Show. Additionally, Thom lines up a good selection of guest speakers with quality inside knowledge and stories which were interesting every time. For those reasons I recommend the class."

More skills quizzes! The topics were all incredibly stimulating, and because we were covering such a broad field of knowledge, I felt we could have been given more of a challenge to chew on in order to cover more of that field. More listening opportunities might also have been useful, maybe a mandatory field trip to a show or having student presentations on shows they'd been to?"

I felt disengaged after a few people went. If it were a shorter amount of class time or only a few people present each week, I think it would be more engaging
-I would have appreciated more instructor lectures on the technical and conceptual decisions in sound design, especially in the beginning of the semester
-Bringing us into the theater for the show was super engaging and I learned a lot being in the actual theater space"
