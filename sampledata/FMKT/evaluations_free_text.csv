Emma is certainly knowledgeable on all things finance, so listening to her analysis and explanations will certainly yield dividends down the road. It's hard to be a dynamic lecturer on a DCF, howeverJohn is a great counterpart as the second half of the course is much more dynamic. He has incredible knowledge of the markets and will test any Duke student on it with the goal of pushing you to think critically about the real world. Lecture style can be daunting, but is very entertaining.The corporate competitions (BlackRock, CorpVal, Goldman) were quite a bit of work and definitely should not be procrastinated. I think most students would agree, however, that these were incredibly useful in increasing our knowledge of course material by actually applying it in a competitive setting."

It is hard to engage with concepts about market movements when you are spending all your time memorizing investment bank CEOs or trying to guess whether the instructors have decided to take exceptions into a rule of thumb into account on a true/false question. Emma’s part of the course is pedantic and tests rote memorization of formulas that can be easily Googled and are not mathematically challenging. John’s part is whatever he feels like. It did not feel like a class environment that was designed for exploration and learning. It was more of an ongoing test of whether you are prepared for banking interviews. Would make more sense as a pass/fail class or lecture series than a graded FMKT elective.

It is the first real finance class that you can take at Duke and I think it is a somewhat good introduction to very basic concepts but as the course went on it really felt like it was more of IB 101 then more about general broad finance concepts.

The environment might feel competitive and will induce impostor syndrome and the instructors will not help with this. If you're not in scale and coin or dsp, don't bother. It is not a welcoming space. If you want to work in finance, you can still engage with and do the financial competitions and attend lecture.

It is much more difficult without previous finance experience. It is not the first finance class you should take if you want to do well and feel confident.

I think I did myself a great disservice by not trying to get to know them better whether it be a flunch, or just staying after class to say thank you. If you are interested in finance you should absolutely take it, just be careful on the videos as wrong answers add up quickly. The video homework assignments are worth in total almost as much as the final exam. I think there were only like 30-40 total video questions which were worth 18 or so percent of the final grade, whereas the final was 20 questions and worth 20% of the final grade. In other words every 2 video questions was worth about as much as a final exam question. Take the videos seriously and do your best to learn from them."

The large lectures make it difficult to engage or feel any sense of connection with either the professors or your classmates. If you learn how to do a DCF and balance sheet and read the WSJ for a semester, you will get basically the same return you would get from this course without the stress of arbitrary grading. I spent a ton of time on this course yet it is currently my lowest grade, despite having significantly less content than other courses.

You get more out of the 1 hour per week student taught investment club's investor training program than this course you are effectively paying thousands of dollars for. I learned virtually nothing. The professors are both amazing and so knowledgeable, but the class structure set them up to fail. this was 90% DIY, and I did not feel at all like the professors were invested in the class's success. It almost felt like the opposite, like they wanted to make full understanding inaccessible."

It's inevitable that you'll be the slacking group member for one of them (if you have an exam, out of town, etc.) so doing all of them definitely maximizes your learning. It sucks in the moment but I really do think it's the best way to learn the material that's presented in class. You can copy formulas from Emma's videos all day long but you will not know how to build these financial models until you actually do them yourself. This class is very much one of those ""you get what you put in"" classes and I highly recommend putting your all into it."

The course seems like it will help your recruiting chances in finance, but your time and effort are better spent watching a youtube video or learning on your own. This course was structured somewhat unreasonably, and the stress it caused me likely hurt my other endeavors and recruiting chances rather than helping. I regret taking this course."

It is not as easy to grade as some people will make it out to be but if you dedicate a decent level of effort to it it will expose you to very interesting potential career paths and teach you some basic skills about how the financial markets work, which is critical to anyone who wants money down the line. It is a great class to take with friends and given that it is only available to you once as a sophomore, I would heavily recommend taking a look at it. Bear in mind there will be a couple of nights towards the latter half of the semester where you are working on the competitions that will be extremely time-consuming if you want a good grade on them."

There are a lot of videos and quizzes that can be confusing. If you have no idea about finance it will force you to learn about it but it wasn't a don't think about class. When we had projects they took a full week to complete and you still weren't always sure if you did them correct. The grading was also tough on the projects with minimal feedback. John's section is full of cold calling so be prepared about markets or you will be asked questions. It isn't totally terrible but could just be an unnecessary stress.

2. John's approach of calling on people and teaching in ""real time"" was great...it kept people engaged, which is challenging to do in a 2.5-hour lecture.

With that, Emma was teaching a lot more of the technicals of finance, like financial modeling and excel spreadsheets and equations. I feel like her part of the course is very important to know (especially going into finance), but wasn't taught in a way that was helpful or intuitive. I feel like I had to self-teach a lot of it as opposed to just being able to learn from class."

Emma is certainly knowledgeable on all things finance, so listening to her analysis and explanations will certainly yield dividends down the road. It's hard to be a dynamic lecturer on a DCF, howeverJohn is a great counterpart as the second half of the course is much more dynamic. He has incredible knowledge of the markets and will test any Duke student on it with the goal of pushing you to think critically about the real world. Lecture style can be daunting, but is very entertaining.The corporate competitions (BlackRock, CorpVal, Goldman) were quite a bit of work and definitely should not be procrastinated. I think most students would agree, however, that these were incredibly useful in increasing our knowledge of course material by actually applying it in a competitive setting."

It is hard to engage with concepts about market movements when you are spending all your time memorizing investment bank CEOs or trying to guess whether the instructors have decided to take exceptions into a rule of thumb into account on a true/false question. Emma’s part of the course is pedantic and tests rote memorization of formulas that can be easily Googled and are not mathematically challenging. John’s part is whatever he feels like. It did not feel like a class environment that was designed for exploration and learning. It was more of an ongoing test of whether you are prepared for banking interviews. Would make more sense as a pass/fail class or lecture series than a graded FMKT elective.

I think I did myself a great disservice by not trying to get to know them better whether it be a flunch, or just staying after class to say thank you. If you are interested in finance you should absolutely take it, just be careful on the videos as wrong answers add up quickly. The video homework assignments are worth in total almost as much as the final exam. I think there were only like 30-40 total video questions which were worth 18 or so percent of the final grade, whereas the final was 20 questions and worth 20% of the final grade. In other words every 2 video questions was worth about as much as a final exam question. Take the videos seriously and do your best to learn from them."

The first half is the complete opposite. If you're not interested in a finance career, you'll probably be bored with all the spreadsheets. Also, the competition projects are stressful for 1-2 weeks, but otherwise, the workload is fine."

The large lectures make it difficult to engage or feel any sense of connection with either the professors or your classmates. If you learn how to do a DCF and balance sheet and read the WSJ for a semester, you will get basically the same return you would get from this course without the stress of arbitrary grading. I spent a ton of time on this course yet it is currently my lowest grade, despite having significantly less content than other courses. Grading is somewhat divorced from effort and highly dependent on luck."

You get more out of the 1 hour per week student taught investment club's investor training program than this course you are effectively paying thousands of dollars for. I learned virtually nothing. The professors are both amazing and so knowledgeable, but the class structure set them up to fail. this was 90% DIY, and I did not feel at all like the professors were invested in the class's success.

It's inevitable that you'll be the slacking group member for one of them (if you have an exam, out of town, etc.) so doing all of them definitely maximizes your learning. It sucks in the moment but I really do think it's the best way to learn the material that's presented in class. You can copy formulas from Emma's videos all day long but you will not know how to build these financial models until you actually do them yourself. This class is very much one of those ""you get what you put in"" classes and I highly recommend putting your all into it."

The course seems like it will help your recruiting chances in finance, but your time and effort are better spent watching a youtube video or learning on your own.

It is not as easy to grade as some people will make it out to be but if you dedicate a decent level of effort to it it will expose you to very interesting potential career paths and teach you some basic skills about how the financial markets work, which is critical to anyone who wants money down the line. It is a great class to take with friends and given that it is only available to you once as a sophomore, I would heavily recommend taking a look at it. Bear in mind there will be a couple of nights towards the latter half of the semester where you are working on the competitions that will be extremely time-consuming if you want a good grade on them."

There are a lot of videos and quizzes that can be confusing. If you have no idea about finance it will force you to learn about it but it wasn't a don't think about class. When we had projects they took a full week to complete and you still weren't always sure if you did them correct. The grading was also tough on the projects with minimal feedback. John's section is full of cold calling so be prepared about markets or you will be asked questions. It isn't totally terrible but could just be an unnecessary stress.

Ultimately, I am very appreciative for the skills and insights we were able to take away from the course. It was great to hear real-life stories and anecdotes that correlated directly with what we were learnings. I think I can safely say I was able to learn how to think about better using information learned, how to correctly allocate a position based on sentiment and what it means to make markets within the financial system."

- Before this course, I knew what options were, but I didn’t fully grasp how to use them strategically. Now I can understand and assess complex options strategies like straddles, strangles, butterflies, and ratio spreads.

Prof. Brown taught it in a way that made it less intimidating than I thought it would be. The class taught me not only trading technical skills and the overall basics, but also how to approach all sorts of problems from a different perspective. Nothing is ever purely technical and that it is often equally, or even more important to consider many other angles than just fundamentals when approaching any type of situation, especially a trade. Specifically, I loved the Binomial probability approach to trading, and overall life, because it made me appreciate an approach to decision making which I hadn't considered in that way before.

I have never given any class such a bad evaluation, but it is the most unorganized class I have ever taken at Duke. There are no grading criterias for any of the assignment and the instructions are only a couple of sentences long. The professor will say that you ""missed an important point"" if your paper does not reflect everything he wants to see. This would be acceptable if there was some kind of grading criteria, but there is none. The class is also all discussion, so be prepared to read and talk about the readings for almost three hours. Personally, I would not recommend this class to a friend because rather than learning, half of your time is spent figuring out how to approach the assignments since you need to guess what the professor expects. The professor also refused to give out a grading criteria/ more instructions for the final project even when many students asked for one."

Weekly ""morning meetings"" where someone at random discusses the Credit Weekly Wrap from Pitchbook LCD. Great way for everyone to have the incentive to stay caught up on what was happening in the credit markets and also get more familiar with the lingo and concepts. Same idea with other materials sent for the Thursday class session, which would be podcasts or news articles. Also super interesting and informative, great way to continue immersing oneself in current trends and events (ex. the sale of X notes and bridge loans, the state of private credit)
2. Modeling exercises spread across 4 weeks or so. Perfect pace and great experience to learn modeling. I learned a lot and got great practice despite already coming in with a good understanding of modeling.
3. Lectures were great for learning. Reviews every week or so were also helpful to make sure concepts stuck."

There is a lot of technical understanding and jargon, especially legal jargon. There was a lot to learn, which helped make the class incredibly interesting. On top of that, there is a good amount of complexity in credit, notably with LMEs and creative transactions. Additionally, we had market discussions that allowed us to apply the concepts we were learning to the real world, providing valuable practice for drawing connections and achieving deeper understanding. An example is when we looked at the sale of X's bonds and drew connections between the OID and pricing for the sale to the current supply and demand dynamics in the overall credit market."

The leveraged buyout simulations created genuine intellectual challenges as we navigated negotiations representing different stakeholders with competing interests. The course pushed us to think beyond obvious outcomes and consider systemic implications. The integration of current market events with theoretical frameworks created a dynamic learning environment where concepts weren't simply memorized but actively applied to evolving situations. This approach cultivated sophisticated critical thinking skills relevant to navigating complex credit markets, all skills that are relevant and useful skills for my future job."

It was truly a great group of people, and the learning experience is top-notch. I think anyone interested in credit should try to take this course. The course did not have a heavy courseload, and it had a great pace throughout the semester. I feel like I learned a ton each class, and there weren't many assignments. Each assignment was useful, anyways. The final group project was also a good way to wrap up the semester and try to simulate an investment committee experience."

Be prepared for a rigorous experience that goes beyond basic financial theory to explore how credit markets actually function during both stable and distressed periods.The case studies and modeling exercises provide practical skills that translate directly to industry roles, while the market analysis components help you develop the judgment needed to evaluate complex leveraged situations. You'll gain valuable insights into how debt structures influence company behavior and investment outcomes. Expect to significantly expand your analytical toolkit.

Took some time, but it was time that accrued to improving my skills and knowledge. Definitely recommend."
