She is a great facilitator of conversation between the class and has taught us to think about frames and photos in a different way then we have before."

I learnt some new editing techniques using Adobe Premiere Pro as well as new things about cameras and how to work in manual mode.

I'm amazed by how Professor Jenny Lion was able to take seemingly widespread concepts and dig deeply into what they meant to our society, so much so that we were able to produce creative video art through examining the contexts of everything we discussed within the course. In Video Art and Politics, I developed a deeper understanding of how moving images can function as both aesthetic expression and political intervention. The course expanded my critical lens as a media maker and viewer. Three specific things I learned are:- The Power of Visual Rhetoric – I gained insight into how visual language, framing, and editing choices can shape political meaning and influence audiences emotionally and intellectually. This helped me reflect more intentionally on my own creative decisions and the messages they convey.- Expanded Definitions of Activism and Art – I learned how artists and filmmakers use nontraditional forms, such as video installations, essay films, and acts of tactical media, as political tools. These works challenged me to rethink the boundaries of what counts as political art and to appreciate the role of experimentation in social critique.- Process as Political Practice – Through the final project and class discussions, I understood how the process of making video art (including collaboration, research, and engagement with communities) can itself be a political act. This insight will continue to shape how I approach media production and storytelling in socially engaged contexts."

Also, Jenny co-ordinated artists to come speak to our class like Wendy Clarke who did The Love Tapes.

One of the most impactful components was the balance between theory and practice—readings and screenings provided historical and conceptual context, while creative assignments allowed us to respond artistically. This dual approach helped me internalize complex ideas through hands-on application. I also appreciated the peer feedback sessions and in-class critiques, which created a collaborative and supportive environment. Hearing from others enriched my perspective and gave me practical suggestions to refine my work.For future years, I’d definitely keep the final project format that allowed us to define our own intervention and work across mediums.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was a great introduction into understanding film on a more technical level! We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

I've learnt to appreciate writing more. We did a lot of writing in this class, from reflections accompanying the different Engage and Mini-Engage assignments and the many free-writes we did in class.

I've done a lot of thinking through writing in this class, more than any other class I've taken this semester.3. I've gotten better at intimate interviews, audio documentation and editing and even video documentation and editing. One thing I enjoyed about the class was the Engage Assignments.

I enjoyed her anecdotes working for newspapers and Nat Geo as well as her one-on-one mentoring that allowed me to appreciate black-and-white as a medium of art. Susie was always willing to spend time talking about problems we were facing and devoted time for office hours to make herself as available as possible."

2) I learned to think and write like a journalist (Dr. Sullivan especially, being a pro-journalist, imparted so much wisdom to us) — I learned about effective, clear, and engaging information delivery, and how to critically analyze sources for relevancy.
3) A specific 'piece' of knowledge that was super thought-provoking for me was the existence of the press as business entities as well, and how much attracting audiences and generating profits that way influenced the inner workings of the press. Applying that to real life was even more eye-opening — the paywalls blocking access to the New York Times and the Washington Post, for example, are an example of business models that work... But is this at the cost of information access (leading to a more informed populace)? This class really helped me ponder questions like this."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","1) I really liked how discussion-oriented our class was — we were provided with a guiding question each lesson, and it was so interesting exploring various facets of the topic and then delving into further 'branches' of discussion based on interesting observations and points of analysis that my classmates made.
2) Our guest speakers were amazing, and I learned so much from listening to them and asking them questions. Len Downie, who was a key figure in the Washington Post's reporting surrounding the Watergate Scandal, for example, spoke to us, and it was so eye-opening hearing about his first-hand experience — it really brought what we learned to life! (IT'D BE SO COOL TO KEEP BRINGING IN AWESOME GUEST SPEAKERS — EXPERTS IN THE JOURNALISM FIELD — FOR FUTURE STUDENTS & FUTURE CLASSES!)
3) By extension, the syllabus was also super clear — readings for each class (accompanied by our guiding discussion question) were laid out since the beginning of the semester, as were our deadlines. This helped me prepare for our class discussions and helped me contextualize the readings and identify key points.
4) I also liked how the class only happened once a week (but for a long time — 2 hours & 30 minutes) — this meant that the class was more low-stress & manageable, which helped with my learning since I had more time to properly digest the material we'd discuss.
5) Our instructors also created an awesome learning environment — they were super casual, which made me feel a lot more comfortable and confident expressing my views!"

Before coming to Duke, I was aware that polarization was a huge issue, but this class provided so much context as to why this was the case.
2) This class made me think about how to be a better journalist (in practice) and brought issues and debates at the forefront of the journalism industry right into our classroom.
3) The course content also helped me consider my own experience with democracy and journalism in my home country, where democracy is eroding — I loved how applicable the course content was!"

Both professors emphasized respect and open-mindedness, which made me more comfortable to share my thoughts/opinions, even if I felt they were underwhelming. I also enjoyed that we made documentary-style episodes. I felt that I was able to express a creative side to myself that I am not usually able to do through my other Duke courses. Moreover, I like that this was a relatively small class as it allowed us all to bond in a way that would not have been possible with a bigger class, while maintaining fruitful discussion. Finally, arguably my favorite part about this course were the class speakers. I loved engaging with women leaders from various states and sectors of the public. I learned the most from them and their interviews."

Whether it was reading our discussion posts each week, asking thought-provoking questions to encourage class conversation, or presenting class concepts through engaging presentations, Saskia helped cultivate an environment where students were excited and interested in what we were learning. Lauren, likewise, brought her invaluable technical expertise when supporting our learning as beginner filmmakers. I greatly valued her feedback on our one-minute videos and full-length documentary, and our final project benefitted immensely from her insight. My favorite aspect of this class was the ability to visit and directly engage with the Duke Campus Farm community. I also appreciate our having had the special opportunity to speak with filmmakers who visited our class and provided additional feedback on our documentaries."

Taking this class taught me how to consider gender theory and climate change - two topics that I had not previously assumed to be connected - in relation to each other. It was unforgettable to be able to learn by physically being at the Duke Campus Farm and building relationships with the people working there.

It was unforgettable to be able to learn by physically being at the Duke Campus Farm and building relationships with the people working there.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This course was a great introduction into understanding film on a more technical level! We began with elements of movies like mise-en scene and cinematography and worked our way into more specific details like acting and sound design. This course has fundamentally changed the way I think about movies and made them so much more fun to watch! For example, for the film Punch Drunk Love, before this course, I would have seen it simply as a quirky and confusing romcom. However, after paying attention to things like cinematography, shot composition, the use of a telephoto lens, etc. it took on a whole new meaning and became so much more engaging to watch. Really grateful for this course helping me to put general intuition about a film into clear meaning and technical wording!One of my favorite things we learned about this semester was looking at the evolution and history of film. The course itself follows this progression in the movies we watch. It was really cool to watch clips of earlier work and inspiration for a certain film and then watch the film itself. This gave us a great perspective on where some of these creative and innovative ideas in cinema came from."

The TAs grade super harshly and make it really hard to know how to do better in the future, which was really frustrating. Even after asking for feedback and support, they did not help us improve our grades. Also, a huge part of this grade is participation (literally speaking once per every class despite it being a large class) and the final project, which made us really nervous."

I'm amazed by how Professor Jenny Lion was able to take seemingly widespread concepts and dig deeply into what they meant to our society, so much so that we were able to produce creative video art through examining the contexts of everything we discussed within the course. In Video Art and Politics, I developed a deeper understanding of how moving images can function as both aesthetic expression and political intervention. The course expanded my critical lens as a media maker and viewer. Three specific things I learned are:- The Power of Visual Rhetoric – I gained insight into how visual language, framing, and editing choices can shape political meaning and influence audiences emotionally and intellectually. This helped me reflect more intentionally on my own creative decisions and the messages they convey.- Expanded Definitions of Activism and Art – I learned how artists and filmmakers use nontraditional forms, such as video installations, essay films, and acts of tactical media, as political tools. These works challenged me to rethink the boundaries of what counts as political art and to appreciate the role of experimentation in social critique.- Process as Political Practice – Through the final project and class discussions, I understood how the process of making video art (including collaboration, research, and engagement with communities) can itself be a political act. This insight will continue to shape how I approach media production and storytelling in socially engaged contexts."

But asking the person whose work it was really what do they need to know, what will help them? I feel like the the first artists using video in the 70s that she showed us were very intriguing and I really enjoyed being exposed to them. Also, Jenny co-ordinated artists to come speak to our class like Wendy Clarke who did The Love Tapes. I found her visit so inspiring that I decided to recreate her work for myself and Jenny kindly connected me with Wendy and formed that connection and gave me lots of advice on how to carry it out respectfully and properly. Jenny said this class is basically about how to change the world - and I really felt like I learnt a lot about activism and how to use my skills in video for things I care about and to help others."

The instructor fostered a space that encouraged experimentation, open dialogue, and personal connection to the material, which was crucial for a course dealing with both art and sociopolitical issues.
One of the most impactful components was the balance between theory and practice—readings and screenings provided historical and conceptual context, while creative assignments allowed us to respond artistically. This dual approach helped me internalize complex ideas through hands-on application. I also appreciated the peer feedback sessions and in-class critiques, which created a collaborative and supportive environment. Hearing from others enriched my perspective and gave me practical suggestions to refine my work.For future years, I’d definitely keep the final project format that allowed us to define our own intervention and work across mediums.

Tim Tyson was arrogant, condescending, and the exact opposite of what I would expect to see in a member of Duke Faculty. To start, he went on an anti semetic rant in class where he said ""no one talks about jew power, but they quietly have power through the banking industry"". While I am not jewish, to see this behavior from a member of such a prestigious university was disgusting. One of my friends in the class is Jewish, and the fact that he had to sit and listen to professor Tysons' ridiculous comments were insane. I also feel very afraid to take action regarding these comments, because Tyson has been extremely vindictive throughout the semester. For example, the majority of the class got an extremely poor grade on the midterm. Instead of trying to help students improve, he said ""if I had taken the test I would have gotten a 100"". I was one of the fortunate few students who got a B (most got a C, D, or F) however he still refused to respond to an email I sent asking him for help in the class. I hope that there is some training given to Tyson in the future to fix his anti semetic and belittling behavior."

On the first day of class Tyson stated that we would have hard conversations that would help us grow. Not a single real conversation about racial relations in the south happened in this class. Instead, each week Tyson would get up there and ramble for the first 90 minutes of class. He is one of the least engaging speakers I have ever listened to. The only reprieve the class would have from Tysons rambling was when professor Williams would get up and sing. Her singing was amazing and was the only positive of each class. When it comes to the readings, Tyson assigned multiple expensive books that he wrote himself. I know that this is common for most professors, however it was extremely frustrating because the books were no different than what he discussed in class. Additionally his two most popular books have been discredited with his Emmitt Till Book being described in one news article as ""Tysons Tall Tales"". I have no problem paying for a book that will enhance my learning. However, when the book is filled with lies made up by a professor who does not care about his students I have a problem purchasing them."

When he woke up, he proceeded to make passive aggressive comments about students in the class not paying attention. He was particularly passive aggressive to athletes in the class and he seemed to have a clear bias against student athletes. This is especially true for the basketball players whom he constantly belittled.

Instead, the professors tend to repeat the same stories and narratives, which does not facilitate further learning or comprehension of the material.

Initially, a take-home midterm was listed in the syllabus, but about a week before the midterm, it was abruptly changed to an in-class midterm without proper notice or consent from the students. By the time grades were returned for that midterm, the deadline to take the class on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis or withdraw had already passed. Additional assignments were introduced after this deadline, and the final exam was no longer the sole examination, contrary to what was stated in the syllabus. The grading is stringent, with all assessments being written responses, and any deviation from the professor's expected answers can result in low or even zero scores, immediately impacting overall grades. Throughout the course, students do not have access to a visible grade book or platform like Canvas, making it challenging to track their progress as the syllabus and assignments continue to change unexpectedly. To perform well, memorizing terms from the assigned readings is essential, as outside information is often dismissed, and only definitions from the specified texts are accepted for full credit."

This is a class for beginner writers of many kinds, but especially the writer who has never dealt with creative ways of expressing ideas. I learned so much about how to write beautifully, how to tell someone's story in a way that does them justice, and how to phrase ideas in unique ways. On top of beautiful writing skills, I learned a lot about how to critique and take criticism. Barry effectively sets an example for how to break down works, both iconic and beginner pieces, and understand their structure, their qualities, and potential improvements. Additionally, we learned how to investigate. I believe this is applicative to many classes. Research is a term broadly used in descriptions for investigative pieces, but Barry emphasizes that research comes in many forms. I loved this class and I can confidently say I have learned the most in this once-a-week seminar compared to any other class at Duke."

I learned specifically about different long form structures, how to break down language, and efffective workshopping."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this course, I developed and strengthened a number of skills that made me a more effective communicator, both within the bounds of journalistic writing and on a broader scale. I improved my ability to deliver complex information in an accessible way, breaking down complicated topics so they could be more digestible to readers who may have little prior experience with the subjects I'm writing about. I worked on bringing in a human voice to the stories I tell, aiming to strike a better balance between explaining the histories and complexities of real-world issues and sharing the personal experiences of people connected to those issues. I also further developed my editing skills, honing my ability to provide thoughtful and helpful feedback to other students in my class -- not just on line edits for grammar/style, but also for larger structural elements like identifying gaps in the reporting and ways to make the overall narrative more engaging and compelling."

I thought the workload was perfectly suited to the course, with enough required engagement with material to ensure that we were growing as readers and writers, but not so much that we were overwhelmed with the number of assignments before us. I enjoyed having one piece to work with each week that we could really dive into, and I liked having the response papers as a vehicle that prompted deeper reflection -- but not required every week to allow for some flexibility when our outside schedules got more intense. Same goes for the schedule of assignments related to the final paper -- I liked having smaller check-in excerpts due throughout the semester to keep us accountable to the reporting process, but appreciated being able to schedule interviews/reporting/writing on a timeline that worked for us up until the full draft was due near the end of the semester."

He incorporated voices of other journalists, he incorporated his own experience, and then he challenged us to interview each other. All three of these activities pointed towards the importance of listening actively and what that looks like. Barry also taught us about trauma-informed interviewing. By going over his own mistakes from the past, he demonstrated how easy it is to come across the wrong way to someone who has experienced trauma. The lesson felt real and genuine, and made approaching difficult subjects must easier. Finally, Barry taught me the importance of research. Going into any interaction whether an interview or an expert opinion, knowing the work and experience of the person on the other side is a demonstration of respect.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Learned how there are a multitude of stories behind language, terminology, and our understanding of the environment. 
2. The origin of colonialism and the anthropocene, and how this history shapes our modern outlooks on the environment and environmental justice. (Example - reviewing the influence of darwinism and what is ""natural"" and ""just"", etc.)
3. Narratives matter, and there are many of them. The differences between writers such as Locke, Darwin, Thoreau, Simmard, Kimmerer, Marsh, and more are astounding and reflect different understandings of the right of humans to take from this Earth and ultimately what the consequences of this become. These highlight how environmental issues cannot be divorced from questions of power, ethics, and equity. These different narratives allows us to evaluate historical paradigms (like commodification of nature) in context of the issues of today. These narratives show that environmental justice is not a single story and its ever-evolving to include and prioritize different ecological and social living systems. 
4. Environmental justice is not just about nature or wilderness. It's not just about economic opportunity. It's everything that surrounds us. It's about recognizing the right of everyone and everything, and the impact it leaves on everything else. It's about recognizing marginalized communities and preservation of spaces. It's about policymaking that reflects a commitment to the well-being of all things, as all things are interrelated. It shows the interconnected framework that integrates social equity, ecological health, and the well-being of all living systems. Environmental justice transcends any single issue. At its core, environmental justice is about reimagining the boundaries of ""us""/""them""/""we"" and instead honoring the reciprocity that must come with our globe through shared responsibility."

Not only did we hear from journalists and journalist experts, but we also heard from students like us who have ventured into journalism and encountered its problems from a fresh perspective. We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning.

Finally, we were continuously encouraged to ask and answer questions, which made the class interactive."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","1. Learned how there are a multitude of stories behind language, terminology, and our understanding of the environment. 
2. The origin of colonialism and the anthropocene, and how this history shapes our modern outlooks on the environment and environmental justice. (Example - reviewing the influence of darwinism and what is ""natural"" and ""just"", etc.)
3. Narratives matter, and there are many of them. The differences between writers such as Locke, Darwin, Thoreau, Simmard, Kimmerer, Marsh, and more are astounding and reflect different understandings of the right of humans to take from this Earth and ultimately what the consequences of this become. These highlight how environmental issues cannot be divorced from questions of power, ethics, and equity. These different narratives allows us to evaluate historical paradigms (like commodification of nature) in context of the issues of today. These narratives show that environmental justice is not a single story and its ever-evolving to include and prioritize different ecological and social living systems. 
4. Environmental justice is not just about nature or wilderness. It's not just about economic opportunity. It's everything that surrounds us. It's about recognizing the right of everyone and everything, and the impact it leaves on everything else. It's about recognizing marginalized communities and preservation of spaces. It's about policymaking that reflects a commitment to the well-being of all things, as all things are interrelated. It shows the interconnected framework that integrates social equity, ecological health, and the well-being of all living systems. Environmental justice transcends any single issue. At its core, environmental justice is about reimagining the boundaries of ""us""/""them""/""we"" and instead honoring the reciprocity that must come with our globe through shared responsibility."

I also particularly loved that the class was outside most of the time in the gardens and around Duke/Durham. Keep all methods of instruction.

Lastly I learned about the barriers women face to get elected into office and what can be done to encourage more women to run and win.

I also enjoyed that we made documentary-style episodes. I felt that I was able to express a creative side to myself that I am not usually able to do through my other Duke courses. Moreover, I like that this was a relatively small class as it allowed us all to bond in a way that would not have been possible with a bigger class, while maintaining fruitful discussion. Finally, arguably my favorite part about this course were the class speakers. I loved engaging with women leaders from various states and sectors of the public.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","Through this course, I developed (and fine-tuned) filmmaking, editing, and software skills by curating student-led film projects in collaboration with community partners in the Triangle area. I gained insights from course texts that engaged with queer and feminist theory, developing new ways of thinking about the current climate crisis, of being in relation with one another, and how (both tangibly and theoretically) to live and embody these concepts (not just read, think, and write about them). I learned how to work collaboratively on a long-term creative project in such a way that builds on our individual and collective strengths. I explored new elements of our relationship to our environment, from our biological traits to the science behind our gut-brain connection."

From our visits to the Duke Campus Farm, I learned about the farm's history and also engaged with specific practices including mulching, weeding, and broad-forking.

I always felt excited going to class because we were doing something new and talking about something meaningful, which expanded my broader knowledge of climate, justice, and their intersection.

As I head into senior year and speak with past seniors, I’m thinking more about what I want to take with me from Duke. For me, that means building deeper relationships and being more present in the community I’ve lived in for four years. This class helped me start doing that."

I learned three distinct things that are valuable as skills as a journalist, as well as skills as a person. Barry really taught me the importance of listening. He did this in several ways. He incorporated voices of other journalists, he incorporated his own experience, and then he challenged us to interview each other. All three of these activities pointed towards the importance of listening actively and what that looks like. Barry also taught us about trauma-informed interviewing. By going over his own mistakes from the past, he demonstrated how easy it is to come across the wrong way to someone who has experienced trauma. The lesson felt real and genuine, and made approaching difficult subjects must easier. Finally, Barry taught me the importance of research. Going into any interaction whether an interview or an expert opinion, knowing the work and experience of the person on the other side is a demonstration of respect. Barry was critical to my passion and love for writing."

I greatly enjoyed the structure of the assignments in which we had a semester-long topic but interviewed a multitude of different people, and I appreciated that the evaluation was largely on the interviewing piece, as that was what we had learned about in class. I also loved the readings and podcasts we did in preparation for the class sessions and thought that the class size was perfect for being able to thoroughly discuss and practice good interviewing and have ethical debates about journalistic practices."

The evaluation system allowed for a low-stress environment while also forcing you to do real work and accomplish significant things (like doing a series of intimate interviews with a stranger). I liked the structure of the course as well, with interviews of advocates coming before the narrative, personal interviews. It allowed me to get more comfortable with interviewing by speaking with people who didn't need as much guidance from the interviewer (me!)."

In doing that, you learn how to ask good questions and follow-up with better ones, how to build source networks and get people to trust you. I came in with an extensive journalism background, having written longform before, and I learned more from this class than I have any other journalism class at Duke. Distilling it into a few things is a disservice to Barry."

I worked on bringing in a human voice to the stories I tell, aiming to strike a better balance between explaining the histories and complexities of real-world issues and sharing the personal experiences of people connected to those issues.

I thought the workload was perfectly suited to the course, with enough required engagement with material to ensure that we were growing as readers and writers, but not so much that we were overwhelmed with the number of assignments before us. I enjoyed having one piece to work with each week that we could really dive into, and I liked having the response papers as a vehicle that prompted deeper reflection -- but not required every week to allow for some flexibility when our outside schedules got more intense. Same goes for the schedule of assignments related to the final paper -- I liked having smaller check-in excerpts due throughout the semester to keep us accountable to the reporting process, but appreciated being able to schedule interviews/reporting/writing on a timeline that worked for us up until the full draft was due near the end of the semester."

Would have liked to see current events consistently integrated into slides/lectures, as opposed to just having one or two lectures dedicated to dissecting Olivia Nuzzi and Mark Robinson or the election. Also could have included pieces from the Daily Show, Fox & Friends, etc. Also, Phil Boyce was an excellent guest and I would have liked to see some more conservative speakers or assignments from/for conservative sources (though I appreciate it's probably difficult to find people willing to talk to a liberal Duke class)."

Keeping up with current events is something that I value, so being able to do so through assignments, lectures, and class discussions was highly enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to make the powerpoints more engaging or perhaps limiting them altogether. Although I understand the informational value they bring, they can also not be particularly intellectually stimulating when taking up the entire class period."

2. We learned about different structures of long form journalism. We learned how to weave information between scenes to create a full picture of an issue and its underlying events. 
3. We read many long form articles and discusses how the authors' choices contributed to the emotional impact, clarity, and flow."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This class was a stellar deep dive into skills I thought I had already acquired. This is a class for beginner writers of many kinds, but especially the writer who has never dealt with creative ways of expressing ideas. I learned so much about how to write beautifully, how to tell someone's story in a way that does them justice, and how to phrase ideas in unique ways. On top of beautiful writing skills, I learned a lot about how to critique and take criticism. Barry effectively sets an example for how to break down works, both iconic and beginner pieces, and understand their structure, their qualities, and potential improvements. Additionally, we learned how to investigate. I believe this is applicative to many classes. Research is a term broadly used in descriptions for investigative pieces, but Barry emphasizes that research comes in many forms. I loved this class and I can confidently say I have learned the most in this once-a-week seminar compared to any other class at Duke."

And throughout both mediums, we were continuously empowered as students to ask questions and contribute to the discussion. Specifically, I think the class speakers are what helped to facilitate student learning. Not only did we hear from journalists and journalist experts, but we also heard from students like us who have ventured into journalism and encountered its problems from a fresh perspective. We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand. Essentially, we got a variety of perspectives on the state of journalism, and this empowered us to use these testimonies to form our own conclusions.I also think all of the writing assignments clearly signaled relevance to the class, and they helped to apply and facilitate our learning. The individual prompts were also well-timed with what we were currently learning about or where we were in the course syllabus/timeline."

2) I learned to think and write like a journalist (Dr. Sullivan especially, being a pro-journalist, imparted so much wisdom to us) — I learned about effective, clear, and engaging information delivery, and how to critically analyze sources for relevancy.
3) A specific 'piece' of knowledge that was super thought-provoking for me was the existence of the press as business entities as well, and how much attracting audiences and generating profits that way influenced the inner workings of the press. Applying that to real life was even more eye-opening — the paywalls blocking access to the New York Times and the Washington Post, for example, are an example of business models that work... But is this at the cost of information access (leading to a more informed populace)? This class really helped me ponder questions like this."

2) Our guest speakers were amazing, and I learned so much from listening to them and asking them questions. Len Downie, who was a key figure in the Washington Post's reporting surrounding the Watergate Scandal, for example, spoke to us, and it was so eye-opening hearing about his first-hand experience — it really brought what we learned to life! (IT'D BE SO COOL TO KEEP BRINGING IN AWESOME GUEST SPEAKERS — EXPERTS IN THE JOURNALISM FIELD — FOR FUTURE STUDENTS & FUTURE CLASSES!)
3) By extension, the syllabus was also super clear — readings for each class (accompanied by our guiding discussion question) were laid out since the beginning of the semester, as were our deadlines. This helped me prepare for our class discussions and helped me contextualize the readings and identify key points.
4) I also liked how the class only happened once a week (but for a long time — 2 hours & 30 minutes) — this meant that the class was more low-stress & manageable, which helped with my learning since I had more time to properly digest the material we'd discuss.
5) Our instructors also created an awesome learning environment — they were super casual, which made me feel a lot more comfortable and confident expressing my views!"

2) This class made me think about how to be a better journalist (in practice) and brought issues and debates at the forefront of the journalism industry right into our classroom.

Even after asking for feedback and support, they did not help us improve our grades. Also, a huge part of this grade is participation (literally speaking once per every class despite it being a large class) and the final project, which made us really nervous."
