For example, I appreciate the pragmatism of Stoicism (I think of myself as stoic to an extent), but some things to me are not indifferents, they're simply bad. I prefer Confucianism's focus on ritual in dealing with loss.3. I've learnt to appreciate writing more. We did a lot of writing in this class, particularly with the jounral entries and the many notes and questions we did in class.

Transforming my worldview & my view of my undergraduate experience—what to prioritize, how to proceed with intentionality. —> Realizing the importance of slowing down & being present.The faculty are incredible. The readings were incredible & helped me reframe the way I thought about how I approached life. Guest speaker conversations (with dinner), especially the one focused on the Israel-Hamas War, really helped me ground reflection into the way I approached politics—it made me realize that religion can't really exist independently of politics, which changed the way I thought about political engagement."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

For example, in one lesson we would learn about the social drivers of health and the different broader forces at play impacting the patient’s health, and in another lecture, we talked about the cultural differences in truth-telling in oncology and medicine.

Professor Dougan was easily able to simplify a paper or many concepts that took me many reads and left me with my head spinning and feeling like there was no point in the paper to bring me to a point of understanding where I felt I could explain it to someone else. He was very kind and respectful, and always took the time to understand our point of view or misunderstandings on a topic to better explain a concept to us. The readings on the course were all very crucial and built up a rigorous foundation for my understanding of religious frameworks of humanitarian aid in a stepwise manner, but also gave differing points of view to allow us to navigate and reconcile conflicting viewpoints for ourselves."

Her reading-recaps are beyond helpful (she takes dense readings and makes them actually digestible), she is always able to answer questions, and she too applies the thinkers that we learned about early on in the semester on a daily basis. Professor Allison is a major component for why this class was so amazing and I think that she really went above and beyond to facilitate learning, engagement, and understanding in her class. Further, I think that she organized the class in a very intentional way. It was very smart to have thinkers first, then medicine, home, and finally disaster. She clearly thought about the structure of the course and every reading that we did / how it would weave together into conversations in class -- and I really commend her for how it played out throughout the semester. Professor Allison was also extremely available for help outside of class (I personally met with her a bunch) and she was overwhelmingly helpful each time. Finally, I really have appreciated the thought that goes into paper prompts because they prompt critical thinking that is engaging, intellectual, but also fun and enjoyable.

- Try to really understand all the thinkers that you learn about in the first unit because they will all come up in conversation throughout the rest of the course and doing this would create a foundation to make the rest of the class easier.
- Just have fun with it! it is challenging but incredibly rewarding. You don't need to understand everything fully, just try your best
- Start your essays as early as possible - the prompts are long and really thought-provoking, which means leaving it to the last minute is not really possible

For me it didn't really feel like horror and more like sci-fi/fantasy that's a bit scary a few times. I also think the creative projects in this class are more engaging and useful than just traditional essays or assignments.

I did not expect this, but I have started to apply the tools we learned in this class on reading and discussing as well as the key concepts and developing ideas in other courses.  In summary, I learned how to go through readings differently and apply new perspectives for future readings as well as connect these to other readings with my own concept I create such as we did in the papers and finally talk through and relearn a reading in a way I did not originally do such as we did in Winart."

The structure of alternating between watching Lovecraft Country and reading scholarly articles provided a dynamic way to understand complex themes. Analyzing Lovecraft Country alongside academic readings made the material both accessible and thought-provoking. Class discussions were essential for unpacking layered themes and allowed for collaborative learning.

I learned how to work towards an ethical conclusion through an argument in this class. Other than this, I learned how to apply what I learned in class to my own life. In other words, my thought process for what I should or shouldn't do has been affected by this class and it has taught me how to make decisions. The way I think has been altered by the topics we've talked about in this class, for example how many spoons you can take from Trinity Cafe. I never would have thought about this before this class, but I feel it has made me a better person. Another thing I learned in this class is how to prioritize different things in my life. Through all of the readings and discussions in class a major theme was what to prioritize. I feel that after all of this, my understanding of the priorities in my life has been made a lot better. You can only focus on so much, so you have to focus on what has meaning to you, which is what I learned through this class."

I also appreciated how we talked about examples from our own lives and connected them to ethics. It truly made it so we could discus the challenges to living an ethical life and how to get around them to do just that.

For example, my favorite assignment for this class was to devise an experiment to test myself and then write about the experiment. That activity taught me more about myself and allowed me to look inward at my own ethical values. I think a little less emphasis on what philosophers say and more introspection about our own ethos could make this class more stimulating."

I think it was all the discussion that made it stimulating. Hearing everybody's opinions and what Professor Summers responded to them was very interesting for me. Also, the fact that we pulled examples out of our own lives made it interesting for me as well. I like to hear about other peoples' lives and most of the things they said applied to my life as well. This made it so I was listening the whole time to hear about other people's lives and the ethics involved. Not to mention, I could connect most of the things to my own life and to ethics as a whole. This was really fun for me and it made the class very stimulating in my own personal opinion."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?",Professor Summers CLEARLY cares so much about what he assigns and how it benefits the students. In the way that he speaks about the readings and his active choice to get students' input on each and every aspect of the class it is so clear that he would never just randomly assign a reading or assignment. I very much so respect his deliberate choices that show care and a forward thinking in his teaching style.

There are weekly (ish) written assignments where we are asked to reflect on our own lives, and then in class we discuss readings with a small group and with the class. I liked the written assignments because they were low-stakes, but encouraged me to think critically about my own life and to connect themes from class. The class is also relatively stress-free, and Dr. Summers emphasizes the importance of discussions over worrying about grades."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Summers did an amazing job bringing up topics for the class to discuss, and then going hands-off and letting the class naturally go into discussion, which often lasted the entire hour and 20 minutes. These were the best classes because I was able to learn from my peer's perspectives, and bounce off the ideas of others. I would keep this kind of instruction, and also all of the articles from that specific website were much more digestible and interesting."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The instructor had us discuss everything with the people at our table to facilitate opinions that can be discussed with the entire class, and I liked how we always started class with table discussions. I also like how the instructor left us with questions to think about at the end of each class, and then we come back next class with our answers to the question to discuss. The way we were given the opportunity to think and come up with thought-provoking answers instead of feeling pressure to just answer immedaitely was a great way of learning how to answer philosophical questions."

I felt bored sometimes listening to classmates discuss things that didn't feel very connected to the themes of the class or readings. Also, our class discussions consisted of the same handful of people that participated constantly, and it would have been nice to see more encouragement for others to participate.

Professor Summers proposed thought-provoking questions and ultimatums in class that really made me rack my brain.

I took several ethics classes in high school, but you can take this class with no ethics experience at all. Dr. Summers pushes you to approach ethical topics that you may have faced several times throughout your life in a new light and from different, challenging perspectives. He makes you question simple things that we take for granted or mindlessly do in our lives, and I appreciated how receptive he is to our feedback. He truly cares about his students, and he tries to prioritize the students' personal reflection and growth over the actual grading system to the best of his ability, which I think adds to the class's environment."

It was great to hear everyone's different point of view and quite comforting to hear that a lot of my peers struggle with some of the concepts that I struggle with in Christianity.

Overall I think that coming out of the course if you genuinely read all the readings and pay time thinking about the various concepts in class you will come out of the class as a much better person.

(2) I really liked our three-week small-group sessions on topics of our choosing — I chose Democracy in Higher Ed with Dr. Eric Mlyn, and we were able to reflect deeply about the state of college education around the US through engaging discussions. We also met some of Dr. Mlyn's student researchers & learned about their research (and learned about how we ourselves could get involved), which was really cool — basically, E189 gave us opportunities to engage in our own specific topics of interest, and also served as a gateway for further opportunities beyond class.
(3) The topics were awesome, and were so applicable to us as college students — we discussed things like the construct of adulthood and whether majors mattered, all of which are really informing how I approach college!"

(1) I really liked when we were separated into different sections (based on our preferences) for three weeks with different ""What Now?"" professors to explore different topic areas — I looked at Democracy in Higher Education with Dr. Eric Mlyn, and I absolutely loved our small-group discussions and how much that helped me reflect on how polarized our current college landscape is. (Our learnings and discussions are also super relevant with heavy student activism on college campuses in elite institutions in action all over the nation right now (regarding sociopolitical and geopolitical issues) — how much free speech actually exists on college campuses, and what constitutes ""free speech""? What is the limit of administration ""protecting"" students regarding this?)
(2) Ethics 189 required us to apply our learning and reflection in tons of different settings, and that really helped me maximize what I took from this class — we went to the Gardens for one lesson, for example, and were encouraged to observe and engage with art (I went to the Asian Students Associations' Converge Showcase) for another asynchronous lesson!
(3) I was able to make tons of connections with my other courses — I enrolled in E189 as a co-requisite for my WR101 class. For example, I loved our discussion on adulthood and the social construct of being an adult, and this definitely was something that applied to my Decoding Disney class (and the concept of Disney audiences being tailored to certain audiences, plus how audience interpretation changes with differing life experiences)!
(4) This really helped me reflect on my approach towards college (& life)!"

My favorite part was breaking into the small groups (That is where I met Professor Prose). I also liked when we had a choice to pick what class we attended for the week. I think this created more intrinsic motivation to attend the classes that you had chosen to go to. Some of the classes were a little less stimulating, like some of the lectures/talks we had. I think a way to allow students to utilize their extra points better, would be to have a list of planned events/classes."

It requires very minimal work outside of class and we often had weeks off. Some of the topics were really interesting, some less so. I highly recommend you do the Taylor Swift section with Professor Andres, or really any section with her, because she's the best and it's by far the most interesting thing you'll do in the class. Also, don't forget to turn in assignments and put some effort into them. There's leeway for missing things but they will be very unimpressed by the work you submit without putting in effort. Also I highly recommend taking advantage of the voice recordings for reflections!"

I think the fact that it was a required course took away a little bit because some students obviously did not want to be there.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","In this course I have developed the skill to debate in an intellectual  by applying course materials to my arguments. I tend to bring forth the arguments of different authors in the course material and provide arguments for and against my stance on the particular subject. This is something that I did not know how to do in high school. I have also  learned how to think through other people's perspectives. I listen carefully to my peers and this helps to think of what I think about their opinions in regards to my  opinions. I have also learned how to engage in constructive dialogue, considering differing opinions from my own, and learning  how to respond to others effectively."

Class discussions were incredibly insightful. We often spent too much time talking about a particular topic, but it was because every student was engaged and we were all learning with each new question brought up. Professor Mlyn often used humor and stories in class, contributing to a light-hearted environment more conducive to learning. Professor Mlyn was also extremely knowledgeable about nearly everything we discussed. For example, we discussed DukeEngage, a program he used to lead, and social innovation, a topic he wrote a book on. If there was a perfect professor to teach this class, it would be him!"

The freedom we are given to explore and analyze different traditions and own views on God, death, suffering, and happiness is refreshing. I don't believe the discussions were as stimulating though because they were in such large groups. The days we were split into smaller groups within our discussion groups was when I  would actually meet and talk with people."

If you want a relatively easy class take this class. If you want a somewhat intellectually stimulating class, I recommend taking a different course. Though the teachers were interesting, the lack of student engagement will impede your own experience. There is a required overnight retreat and a dialogue section weekly which aren't noted on the course description. This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class.

This course requires you to submit 2 questions a week on canvas, 10 reflective journal entries, 1 acting performance, and 1 final paper. Overall it is a very manageable class. You get what you put into this course, so know that before enrolling."

2. One thing I learned about was the practice of regenerative agriculture. I hadn't know about it at all and I had been much more cynical about non-industrial farming, but after our readings/videos/field trips, I'm much more convinced that reg. agr. could be a beneficial way forward.
3. One way of thinking that I hopefully developed was the very logical, almost mathematical approach that philosophers like Norcross take in their writing. Using ""marginal cases"" and proving that an argument is logically incoherent."

We explored how despite the widely held view that these beliefs are not scientifically based, their knowledge has been proven to be valid through formal experimentation. We also discussed the growing movement of regenerative farming and how it has the potential to restore natural landscapes, save money, and create higher crop yields. Finally, we explored environmentalism through the lens of Pope Francis in his writing Laudato Si. We discussed his ideas of the technocratic paradigm and how it has led to increased consumerism and a detachment from the natural world."

It gave me so much insight into how to think about things like science, neuroscience, biology from not only a scientific perspective but also a perspective that is focused on questioning the nature of these things. I'm a computer science major and never really got exposure to natural sciences as a whole and this class was a perfect way to be able to get that exposure. It was amazing to be able to touch on so many things such as physics, biology, computer science even from a perspective of philosophical inquiry and relating it to religion.

I was really forced to understand the concepts underlying some of the most important questions that we as humans face, such as the reliability of our cognitive faculties. The essay prompts broke down these concepts and I'm definitely going to be breaking down complicated concepts in a similar way that the professor did for future difficult essays. 
2. Understanding of neuroscience -- I'm not a neuroscience major and so I had no prior knowledge on how the brain worked at all. Getting to hold a human brain in my own hands was really special and I thought that the level of information that we could get was varied enough that a neuroscience major would learn something and a newbie like me could as well. 
3. One of my biggest insights into the class was being truly captivated by my fellow Duke peers' intellect. Many of us came from different majors and backgrounds and every person added such an interest take to the conversations. I was truly impressed with the depth of knowledge and philosophical thinking of my peers."

I truly enjoyed learning about the intersections between science and religion, in a way that held space for all opinions, faiths, and backgrounds. I didn't feel like one faith or perspective was pressed onto us, and I learned how to dive into my thoughts and mind and truly decide where I stood on issues. I learned how complex conversations surrounding evolution truly are through the different evolutionary theories-- I did not realize how much of evolutionary theory was not agreed upon, because in high school it seemed like Darwinian- natural selection was the main and agreed upon definition of evolution. Also, I have never taken a philosophy class before, and I am so glad I took this one, because I learned about various ancient philosophers, how to contrast their ideas, and specifically learned about their ideas of the mind and God, which I find fascinating as a Neuroscience student. Finally, we went to Prof. Len White's brain lab, and I had so much fun going in the context of this course. Looking at the biological brain, but harboring these deep questions about religion and what it means to be human in the back of my mind from our readings, was truly remarkable."

Also, Prof. Watkins always held office hours, and doing so showed be that he was very determined to provide us students support, even if that meant taking away his personal work time.

I liked his structure with a reading assignment (and sometimes a very short reading response) and then a class discussion on the reading. But these were very low-stakes and unstressful conversations where he had a set of discussion questions and prompts ready to promote conversation and debate. Professor Watkins did a wonderful job keeping the class engaged and interested in the material with several guest lecturers and class visits. We even got to go to Dr. White's brain lab in DIBS!

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","QUESTION ONE:
1. Engaging Lectures: Both the instructor's dynamic lectures and his incorporation of incredible guest lectures combined clear explanations of scientific concepts with thought-provoking questions that encouraged deeper exploration, in a non-conventional lecture format.
Discussion-Based Learning: The emphasis on open discussion allowed students to express diverse viewpoints and refine their arguments collaboratively. After each comment, the instructor maintained the ideal balance between validating his students' beliefs, further fostering an environment in which communication is valid, and also challenging them, asking follow-up questions intended with gauging their depth of analysis.
QUESTION TWO (Components to Retain):
1. Interdisciplinary Readings: Including a blend of neuroscience papers, religious texts, and philosophical essays was invaluable for a holistic learning experience. I will most definitely be re-reading my favorites of the one's he provided, like Lucretius and Plantinga. Not a single reading was short of exceedingly awe-provoking.
Interactive Class Discussions: These fostered a sense of intellectual curiosity among students, compelling me to take the class' complex commentary on the workings of the world with me everywhere I go as I continue to grapple with pressing inquiries, like the pursuit for meaning and the epistemological explanation for existence."

It made me realize how empiricism is another school of thought, and our current world might be biased towards it. But there is something undeniably visceral about the human experience, that cannot be explained by science, at least not right now, and so there must be room for some higher power... this is a kind of conversation we would have in class!

Don't take this class because of the T-reqs or the CS elective credit, but because you are genuinely interested in this topic.
2. Otherwise you will not last for a week, since weekly take-home readings range from 30 pages to 100+ pages, and 1000 word reading reflections are submitted every week.
3. But if you are genuinely interested in this topic, there is no better class at Duke that will facilitate that interest.
4. Professor Hartemink and Professor Ebert actually read all of your writings and leave personalized feedbacks (sometimes longer than my submission).
5. Even if you don't come out of this course feeling enlightened, you will still be much more knowledgable about how classical philosophy plays into modern technologies."

We heard from right-wing-leaning media owners. We heard from people who were impacted by right-wing media rabbit holes firsthand.

Would have liked to see current events consistently integrated into slides/lectures, as opposed to just having one or two lectures dedicated to dissecting Olivia Nuzzi and Mark Robinson or the election. Also could have included pieces from the Daily Show, Fox & Friends, etc. Also, Phil Boyce was an excellent guest and I would have liked to see some more conservative speakers or assignments from/for conservative sources (though I appreciate it's probably difficult to find people willing to talk to a liberal Duke class)."

Keeping up with current events is something that I value, so being able to do so through assignments, lectures, and class discussions was highly enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to make the powerpoints more engaging or perhaps limiting them altogether. Although I understand the informational value they bring, they can also not be particularly intellectually stimulating when taking up the entire class period."

Bill is a fantastic professor who makes lectures fun and will introduce you to a variety of interesting topics. You'll learn a lot about media and meet super cool people in the industry.

Professor Hazelwood frequently laments the inaccessibility/pretentiousness of philosophical writing, so by constantly reading examples of good and bad prose or and argumentation, as well as writing our own philosophical papers, I left the class with a better understanding of how to write effective and readable philosophy papers.
2. I developed my argumentation skills. With two in-class debates worked into the curriculum, we had a chance to put our ideas to the test against our fellow students. This was a great exercise in research, argument preparation, and effective delivery of complex ideas. 
3. As an applied ethics course, this class helped bridge the gap between what we learn in classrooms and how we live outside school. The ""Living Ethically"" semester-long project, as well as the content of many of the readings, helped to demonstrate the link between philosophy and praxis and pushed me to reflect harder on my everyday habits."

Professor Hazelwood changed the reading quiz structure at the midpoint of the semester in response to student feedback and I think the final structure was very effective. I liked the reading quizzes because as long as you did the reading, it'll be easy, but if you didn't, you'll do poorly, so I found them to be fair and manageable, but by including an option for annotations in lieu of a quiz this was very accommodating to students who do the readings but may just not be great test-takers. I loved the debates, they were fun. The living ethically assignment was a great way to tie class concepts to the outside world, which is kind of the whole point of the class so that was great too. Podcast was a cool chance to discuss class concepts further with a real expert in the field.

I have been in a lot of classes where nobody actually does the reading, and the class ends up being the professor lecturing at the classroom, with very little room for actual deep and thoughtful discussion. The concept of having a quiz at the beginning of class is scary, and was at times stressful, but it did ensure that class ran very smoothly and was full of actual thoughtful conversation, as opposed to simply being a recap of the text."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Hazelwood's teaching style, while strong from the start, wonderfully adapted to the needs and culture of the class, greatly enhancing our ability to engage with and consume content. For example, Professor Hazelwood would provide reading assessments to determine our engagement with written material prior to class. After receiving feedback requesting a different form of assessment more accessible for those who may have testing anxiety (or anything else other than their understanding of the reading that would limit their ability to perform will on the quizzes), Professor Hazelwood immediately provided an option that allowed thorough annotations of the text to stand in for the reading assessments. I would love for the annotating option to be available in the future, and I found having both the quiz and annotation options to be very beneficial to my learning.Additionally, Professor Hazelwood's classroom management was perhaps the greatest asset for my learning. He expertly guided discussion, providing helpful information and direction where needed. I truly felt that my classmates and I were learning from each other and working towards 'the answers' (as much as there are in philosophy), and there was always a sense of accomplishment when we realized we had 'gotten' a point. Professor Hazelwood was excellent at affirming our viewpoints (or constructively and kindly pointing us in a different direction). The discussion based classroom, particularly due to Professor Hazelwood's involvement, really helped me to retain content, as it ensured that all of the students logically work through readings, rather than being handed a point or simply memorizing an argument structure."

It was extremely refreshing to hear about new content, particularly from a variety of perspectives. Professor Hazelwood did an excellent job of curating our readings such that each week we often had papers 'for' the topic at hand and other papers 'against' which enabled us to engage with each other and have productive disagreements. I really appreciated hearing both sides of various debates, and it made class discussion much more intellectually stimulating. The content covered was challenging, but not beyond our capabilities, which also made the class more engaging. I also feel that Professor Hazelwood's personality contributed to students' engagement in the course. While serious when necessary, his warm demeanor and humor was excellent at drawing students in to participate and feel confident in presenting their viewpoints. While in the past I have been terrified of 'cold calling', on the somewhat rare occasion Professor Hazelwood used it, I felt empowered (rather than anxious) to share my answer or even admit my lack of understanding on a specific aspect of a topic. Professor Hazelwood did a great job of bringing everyone into the conversation and validating viewpoints, and very quickly our class time turned into free-flowing discussions where nearly everyone thoughtfully engaged several times."

Importantly, capitalism is not just a ""market system,"" it is a way of governing all life. It consumes every aspect of our lives, even ones that we wouldn't expect, such as our most personal and intimate relationships. I learned that we already have all the money, food, housing, healthcare, etc that we need for every human being to live a decent life, but these resources are fundamentally distributed such that the top 1% receives them all, while the poor suffer. We don't need more exponential GDP growth to solve the dysfunctions capitalism has created; we need degrowth."

This isn't a class where ""every answer is right"" and you get a gold star just for speaking, which I really enjoyed. It allowed me to reflect on my thoughts and arguments and to not say things as statements, but to truly form an argument. This class made me think in entirely new ways through the readings that were assigned.I would KEEP most of the argument exercises, I do not think all 4 parts are necessary. I think that the quote and teasing out the central argument is important, but probably not parts 3 and 4 as they felt quite repetitive. I would definitely keep both the CAP and the Why capitalism matters Paper. Most of the readings were excellent and insightful, but I think at times some were repetitive. Having four every week was definitely overwhelming at times, but I'm ultimately glad to have read them.I would also keep the cold calling, it forced everyone to read the readings assigned and stay engaged throughout discussions.

Dr. Hy was incredible at creating a warm and welcome environment—they began the semester establishing a community agreement, and the agreement of ‘recognizing the both/and’ (i.e., recognizing that multiple realities can be true at once, and therefore having this foster constructive and safe dialogue across differences) really resonated with me for the rest of the semester (and will beyond this semester)
2. Dr. Hy’s (and Carina, our TA’s) emphasis on progress over perfection—even if our submissions weren’t perfect, they encouraged us to submit our assignments anyway. As a lifelong perfectionist, still being recognized for ‘work in progress’ and my thoughts and writing in ‘first draft form’ helped massively in making me feel more confident and able to articulate my semi-formed thoughts, which really helped me engage with the course more—I really, really appreciated this"

2. Systems Change Project, where we were grouped by areas of research interest (e.g., tech policy, healthcare equity, etc.)—this allowed us to apply our learnings directly to an area of interest tied to our summer research as well, which really helped us prepareCould’ve been more stimulating:
1. I also really, really loved our class discussions! That being said, the format for the first half of the semester also began to feel a little repetitive (every Monday, we’d discuss each reading first in our small groups and then with the class, and every Wednesday we’d do the same thing with a different group (‘communities of practice’)). This was before we began our guest speaker lessons, though—that really elevated our learning, and made each lesson super interesting!

We skipped multiple Thursday courses, the professor set aside half of the semester for student presentations, and half of the time when he would lecture, it was deliberately inflammatory and combative. While the professor was obviously incredibly smart, it was overshadowed by his desire to bring up controversial conversations. While it was helpful to hear conservative opinions, I wish it was done in an educational sense or at least carried through the entire semester. I didn't feel as though I learned much at all due to the structure and method of teaching."

He was very kind and respectful, and always took the time to understand our point of view or misunderstandings on a topic to better explain a concept to us. The readings on the course were all very crucial and built up a rigorous foundation for my understanding of religious frameworks of humanitarian aid in a stepwise manner, but also gave differing points of view to allow us to navigate and reconcile conflicting viewpoints for ourselves."

Dr. Wagner has great opinions on a lot of these topics, and I think most people would appreciate to hear her thoughts on things. She did a wonderful job guiding discussions, sometimes filling in gaps in our arguments in a way I found quite impressive. She is also a wonderful speaker, articulating complicated topics clearly and thoughtfully. To make the class more stimulating, I'd consider adding more chances for students to select outside sources."

Being able to talk about how different people approach vocation within a college setting also was cool because it was a connection that the issue at hand is not only historical but ever-present in our everyday life."

I enjoyed getting to read from such a wide variety of authors and sources across the Christian tradition, and I think I was able to articulate certain claims and explore them deeply through the amount of discussion, reading, and writing that we did. It was cool to be able to connect ideas from the Bible, pre and post modernity"

If you wondered whats the purpose of your life or have wanted to dialogue and understand how people have came to that decision from the perspective of someone believing in a higher power or someone who is secular, it is both good for that. While you will not die if you do not do the readings, to get the most out of the class wanting to engage by reading and talking during discussion is heavily promoted."

Seriously an amazing course... I was very nervous to take to at first but I haven't regretted it for a moment.

She is astoundingly brilliant on all fronts, has thought a lot about the topic of hope, and genuinely cares about what your thoughts are on the readings. Her reading-recaps are beyond helpful (she takes dense readings and makes them actually digestible), she is always able to answer questions, and she too applies the thinkers that we learned about early on in the semester on a daily basis. Professor Allison is a major component for why this class was so amazing and I think that she really went above and beyond to facilitate learning, engagement, and understanding in her class. Further, I think that she organized the class in a very intentional way. It was very smart to have thinkers first, then medicine, home, and finally disaster. She clearly thought about the structure of the course and every reading that we did / how it would weave together into conversations in class -- and I really commend her for how it played out throughout the semester. Professor Allison was also extremely available for help outside of class (I personally met with her a bunch) and she was overwhelmingly helpful each time. Finally, I really have appreciated the thought that goes into paper prompts because they prompt critical thinking that is engaging, intellectual, but also fun and enjoyable.

I cannot stress this enough. 
- Try to really understand all the thinkers that you learn about in the first unit because they will all come up in conversation throughout the rest of the course and doing this would create a foundation to make the rest of the class easier.
- Just have fun with it! it is challenging but incredibly rewarding. You don't need to understand everything fully, just try your best
- Start your essays as early as possible - the prompts are long and really thought-provoking, which means leaving it to the last minute is not really possible
- Also meet with professor Allison outside of class! She really is the best!"

From the very first day, I was impressed by how much she already knew about each of us, and throughout the course, she continuously integrated our ideas into the class. That made the learning experience feel incredibly personal and intentional.Overall, we learned the deep importance and transformative power of storytelling as a tool to help build a world where every living being can flourish. Storytelling is one of the most powerful tools for change because it’s deeply embedded in how humans have shared knowledge for millennia—and because it speaks directly to the emotional part of the brain that shapes decision-making.Through this course, I learned:
1.  How to use artistic storytelling techniques and frameworks to craft narratives for social impact.
2. The science behind why stories move people and how they can shape attitudes, behaviors, and policies.
3. How to identify and counteract harmful or dominant narratives by telling stories that align with our values and vision for a better world."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This was the only class I've taken in Duke that challenged my way of thinking, I would have multiple ""aha"" moments in the course related to fundamental aspects of society, change, power, etc. that are missing in every other course.Insights- understanding parallel ways of communication, their intention, impact, power, strengths, weaknesses, and how to structure them. I feel incredible empowered to use this information to frame policy, and feel like I am walking away with value that all students should be getting because I took this course.Methods/skills- this is the only class where we consistently analyze and really go deep into the underlying ideas, values, impacts, and structure of development. Even though it was an international development course, the application is across all sectors because most policy we're interested in (schools, transpiration, etc.) is touched by development and is at its core, a subsection of development. I found the class to be highly relevant to every aspect of policymaking, and the process of metacognition, reflection, and analysis is unmatched. The skills and methods in ways of thinking I learned and practiced in this class are the most valuable aspect of my MPP so far.Knowledge- I learned so much about how a topic I was interested in- communicating policy- has a wide field around it that has very intentional goals and being able to really get exposure to the macro-level landscape that then shapes our ideas as policy makers that we're exposed to in the world, and then understanding how to TRULY analyze those options and expand, was a highlight. In prep for our final paper, we reviewed key parts of our work and key readings to reflect on and were asked which reading we would remove from the syllabus- I did not have a single one I would remove because I was so grateful for all that I learned. Meanwhile, in other courses you can get an A without ever doing the reading b/c the readings don't add anything and the professors just ask for you to spit back what they told you. Admay actually teaches you how to think, teaches you how to analyze, reflect, meaningfully synthesize, etc. and those skills are the kind that make leaders, create change, and actually influence policy."

When we create our own lessons for the class, she requires so much intentionality and focus in prep, ensuring that all student projects are valuable and also teaching us what kind of intentionality we should bring to any presentation/workshop where we're asking for others' precious time. She's incredibly thoughtful, reflective, intentional, and smart. How she thinks, and what she says, are so valuable.I also really love the human aspect of this course, Admay emphasizes community and wellbeing and it really, really shows. She does not waste our time, she does not give us busy work, and all the assignments are intentional. She is understanding and flexible, open to new ideas of how things should go, and strikes the ideal teacher balance of firm, high expectations and loving, warm support to get there."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","I completely changed my reading style throughout this course.  We had to tackle a lot of challenging texts, but I think the order in which we completed them made sense because we had to use the concepts as perspectives for future readings.  It was an interesting anthropological course, something I was not used to, we did not do a lot of field work and creating our own ethnographic work, nor did we solely read ethnographic material.  I did not expect this, but I have started to apply the tools we learned in this class on reading and discussing as well as the key concepts and developing ideas in other courses.  In summary, I learned how to go through readings differently and apply new perspectives for future readings as well as connect these to other readings with my own concept I create such as we did in the papers and finally talk through and relearn a reading in a way I did not originally do such as we did in Winart."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","As a hardcore STEM enthusiast, I never in my life thought I would sit through a small public policy seminar during my first semester of college. But, looking in retrospect, this seminar was my one of my favorite classes that I have taken. First, I learned to think outside the ""norm."" During class, we called our professors by their first names and sat on bean bags and wool carpets instead of chairs. We had wild discussions ranging from prison abolition to using our body to connect with our thoughts (""dance is thought""). These discussions made me think outside the box and realize that if I continue to imagine the seemingly radical ideas, maybe one day it will become a reality. Secondly, I learned how to analyze texts and lead discussions/debates that differed from my personal, political, and ethical views. Our discussion section was very close-knit and welcoming, and I learned to value not only sharing my own opinions but also listening to other's viewpoints and peacefully debating controversial topics. Finally, I learned the value of exploring various ways to approach radical ideas. For instance, throughout class, we used our body to get in touch with our radical view of the world. This was very stimulating and eye-opening in that movement can change our thoughts and be used as a vehicle to explore the most radical ideas that are subconsciously in our brain."

I have always battled internally whether my movements lead to my dance moves or my movements led to the feeling of liberation I always have when I'm dancing. But through this course, I realized that dance is purely just my thinking; movement is thought. This course taught me how to view my dancing career and also imagine for liberation.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","As a hardcore STEM enthusiast, I never in my life thought I would sit through a small public policy seminar during my first semester of college. But, looking in retrospect, this seminar was my one of my favorite classes that I have taken. First, I learned to think outside the ""norm."" During class, we called our professors by their first names and sat on bean bags and wool carpets instead of chairs. We had wild discussions ranging from prison abolition to using our body to connect with our thoughts (""dance is thought""). These discussions made me think outside the box and realize that if I continue to imagine the seemingly radical ideas, maybe one day it will become a reality. Secondly, I learned how to analyze texts and lead discussions/debates that differed from my personal, political, and ethical views. Our discussion section was very close-knit and welcoming, and I learned to value not only sharing my own opinions but also listening to other's viewpoints and peacefully debating controversial topics. Finally, I learned the value of exploring various ways to approach radical ideas. For instance, throughout class, we used our body to get in touch with our radical view of the world. This was very stimulating and eye-opening in that movement can change our thoughts and be used as a vehicle to explore the most radical ideas that are subconsciously in our brain."

One quote from Brookes and the reading that will forever stick with me is ""dance is thought."" As a dancer, this quote stays in my heart as I perform and practice every time. I have always battled internally whether my movements lead to my dance moves or my movements led to the feeling of liberation I always have when I'm dancing. But through this course, I realized that dance is purely just my thinking; movement is thought. This course taught me how to view my dancing career and also imagine for liberation. As the professors said, radical imaginations are always needed for real change."

Keeping up with current events is something that I value, so being able to do so through assignments, lectures, and class discussions was highly enjoyable. My only suggestion would be to make the powerpoints more engaging or perhaps limiting them altogether. Although I understand the informational value they bring, they can also not be particularly intellectually stimulating when taking up the entire class period."

I don't think this is the fault of the professor but more the class makeup -- it was dominated by students with the same ideologies getting their news from large papers that skewed left of center. Maybe in order to combat this, more of the readings could be from conservative outlets or perhaps ""extra credit"" of not only keeping up with Reliable Sources/The Morning but also regularly consuming news from right-leaning papers. Not sure how feasible that is but an idea."

Professor Hazelwood frequently laments the inaccessibility/pretentiousness of philosophical writing, so by constantly reading examples of good and bad prose or and argumentation, as well as writing our own philosophical papers, I left the class with a better understanding of how to write effective and readable philosophy papers.
2. I developed my argumentation skills. With two in-class debates worked into the curriculum, we had a chance to put our ideas to the test against our fellow students. This was a great exercise in research, argument preparation, and effective delivery of complex ideas. 
3. As an applied ethics course, this class helped bridge the gap between what we learn in classrooms and how we live outside school. The ""Living Ethically"" semester-long project, as well as the content of many of the readings, helped to demonstrate the link between philosophy and praxis and pushed me to reflect harder on my everyday habits."

Professor Hazelwood changed the reading quiz structure at the midpoint of the semester in response to student feedback and I think the final structure was very effective. I liked the reading quizzes because as long as you did the reading, it'll be easy, but if you didn't, you'll do poorly, so I found them to be fair and manageable, but by including an option for annotations in lieu of a quiz this was very accommodating to students who do the readings but may just not be great test-takers. I loved the debates, they were fun. The living ethically assignment was a great way to tie class concepts to the outside world, which is kind of the whole point of the class so that was great too. Podcast was a cool chance to discuss class concepts further with a real expert in the field. Honestly every part of the class was great and felt like it had a very intentional reason for being included in the curriculum."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","This class was by far my favorite class of the semester, and a large part of that was due to Caleb. The learning environment was very welcoming. As someone who has never taken a philosophy class at Duke, I was worried that I would struggle to grasp the concepts and fall behind, but Caleb was a great teacher who explained the concepts well and made this class an enjoyable experience for me. I like that the class had a lot of different types of assignments, like the vlog assignment and the podcast assignment, that kept it interesting and pushed the boundaries of what I usually do in classes."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","I think that the quizzes at the beginning of each class were very valuable in making sure that everyone understood the material and came to class prepared to talk. I have been in a lot of classes where nobody actually does the reading, and the class ends up being the professor lecturing at the classroom, with very little room for actual deep and thoughtful discussion. The concept of having a quiz at the beginning of class is scary, and was at times stressful, but it did ensure that class ran very smoothly and was full of actual thoughtful conversation, as opposed to simply being a recap of the text."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","Professor Hazelwood's teaching style, while strong from the start, wonderfully adapted to the needs and culture of the class, greatly enhancing our ability to engage with and consume content. For example, Professor Hazelwood would provide reading assessments to determine our engagement with written material prior to class. After receiving feedback requesting a different form of assessment more accessible for those who may have testing anxiety (or anything else other than their understanding of the reading that would limit their ability to perform will on the quizzes), Professor Hazelwood immediately provided an option that allowed thorough annotations of the text to stand in for the reading assessments. I would love for the annotating option to be available in the future, and I found having both the quiz and annotation options to be very beneficial to my learning.Additionally, Professor Hazelwood's classroom management was perhaps the greatest asset for my learning. He expertly guided discussion, providing helpful information and direction where needed. I truly felt that my classmates and I were learning from each other and working towards 'the answers' (as much as there are in philosophy), and there was always a sense of accomplishment when we realized we had 'gotten' a point. Professor Hazelwood was excellent at affirming our viewpoints (or constructively and kindly pointing us in a different direction). The discussion based classroom, particularly due to Professor Hazelwood's involvement, really helped me to retain content, as it ensured that all of the students logically work through readings, rather than being handed a point or simply memorizing an argument structure."

It was the epitome of intellectual exploration because sometimes we'd get on a tangentially related topic that everyone found interesting and we'd just see it through and keep discussing it even if it wasn't on the agenda, which meant we got to cover not just the assigned readings but all the different ideas students had that were sparked by the readings."

It was extremely refreshing to hear about new content, particularly from a variety of perspectives. Professor Hazelwood did an excellent job of curating our readings such that each week we often had papers 'for' the topic at hand and other papers 'against' which enabled us to engage with each other and have productive disagreements. I really appreciated hearing both sides of various debates, and it made class discussion much more intellectually stimulating. The content covered was challenging, but not beyond our capabilities, which also made the class more engaging. I also feel that Professor Hazelwood's personality contributed to students' engagement in the course. While serious when necessary, his warm demeanor and humor was excellent at drawing students in to participate and feel confident in presenting their viewpoints. While in the past I have been terrified of 'cold calling', on the somewhat rare occasion Professor Hazelwood used it, I felt empowered (rather than anxious) to share my answer or even admit my lack of understanding on a specific aspect of a topic. Professor Hazelwood did a great job of bringing everyone into the conversation and validating viewpoints, and very quickly our class time turned into free-flowing discussions where nearly everyone thoughtfully engaged several times."

I don't think that I have felt as close to a group of students and professor as I have in this class. Caleb made me look forward to going to class twice each week, and I knew I was going to learn something new and hear different perspectives. Caleb also has a clear mastery of his craft, not only in the philosophy of biology, but in a speaker and philosophical interlocutor."

Personally, it was the coveted class of the semester that I really looked forward to attending. While there are a couple of group projects, I felt the work required for them wasn't stressful. Professor Hazelwood is a very fair grader, provides quality feedback to support his grading decisions, and is also willing to provide extra credit opportunities. It's definitely a class where the work you put in directly results in your grade, so as long as you do your assignments with good effort, you should do well in the course. Professor Hazelwood is also extremely helpful in office hours and provides thorough and detailed feedback."

It consumes every aspect of our lives, even ones that we wouldn't expect, such as our most personal and intimate relationships.

It allowed me to reflect on my thoughts and arguments and to not say things as statements, but to truly form an argument. This class made me think in entirely new ways through the readings that were assigned.I would KEEP most of the argument exercises, I do not think all 4 parts are necessary. I think that the quote and teasing out the central argument is important, but probably not parts 3 and 4 as they felt quite repetitive. I would definitely keep both the CAP and the Why capitalism matters Paper. Most of the readings were excellent and insightful, but I think at times some were repetitive. Having four every week was definitely overwhelming at times, but I'm ultimately glad to have read them.I would also keep the cold calling, it forced everyone to read the readings assigned and stay engaged throughout discussions.

2. Dr. Hy’s (and Carina, our TA’s) emphasis on progress over perfection—even if our submissions weren’t perfect, they encouraged us to submit our assignments anyway. As a lifelong perfectionist, still being recognized for ‘work in progress’ and my thoughts and writing in ‘first draft form’ helped massively in making me feel more confident and able to articulate my semi-formed thoughts, which really helped me engage with the course more—I really, really appreciated this"

1. I also really, really loved our class discussions! That being said, the format for the first half of the semester also began to feel a little repetitive (every Monday, we’d discuss each reading first in our small groups and then with the class, and every Wednesday we’d do the same thing with a different group (‘communities of practice’)). This was before we began our guest speaker lessons, though—that really elevated our learning, and made each lesson super interesting!

We skipped multiple Thursday courses, the professor set aside half of the semester for student presentations, and half of the time when he would lecture, it was deliberately inflammatory and combative. While the professor was obviously incredibly smart, it was overshadowed by his desire to bring up controversial conversations. While it was helpful to hear conservative opinions, I wish it was done in an educational sense or at least carried through the entire semester.

From the very first day, I was impressed by how much she already knew about each of us, and throughout the course, she continuously integrated our ideas into the class. That made the learning experience feel incredibly personal and intentional.Overall, we learned the deep importance and transformative power of storytelling as a tool to help build a world where every living being can flourish. Storytelling is one of the most powerful tools for change because it’s deeply embedded in how humans have shared knowledge for millennia—and because it speaks directly to the emotional part of the brain that shapes decision-making.Through this course, I learned:
1.  How to use artistic storytelling techniques and frameworks to craft narratives for social impact.
2. The science behind why stories move people and how they can shape attitudes, behaviors, and policies.
3. How to identify and counteract harmful or dominant narratives by telling stories that align with our values and vision for a better world."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","This was the only class I've taken in Duke that challenged my way of thinking, I would have multiple ""aha"" moments in the course related to fundamental aspects of society, change, power, etc. that are missing in every other course.Insights- understanding parallel ways of communication, their intention, impact, power, strengths, weaknesses, and how to structure them. I feel incredible empowered to use this information to frame policy, and feel like I am walking away with value that all students should be getting because I took this course.Methods/skills- this is the only class where we consistently analyze and really go deep into the underlying ideas, values, impacts, and structure of development. Even though it was an international development course, the application is across all sectors because most policy we're interested in (schools, transpiration, etc.) is touched by development and is at its core, a subsection of development. I found the class to be highly relevant to every aspect of policymaking, and the process of metacognition, reflection, and analysis is unmatched. The skills and methods in ways of thinking I learned and practiced in this class are the most valuable aspect of my MPP so far.Knowledge- I learned so much about how a topic I was interested in- communicating policy- has a wide field around it that has very intentional goals and being able to really get exposure to the macro-level landscape that then shapes our ideas as policy makers that we're exposed to in the world, and then understanding how to TRULY analyze those options and expand, was a highlight. In prep for our final paper, we reviewed key parts of our work and key readings to reflect on and were asked which reading we would remove from the syllabus- I did not have a single one I would remove because I was so grateful for all that I learned. Meanwhile, in other courses you can get an A without ever doing the reading b/c the readings don't add anything and the professors just ask for you to spit back what they told you. Admay actually teaches you how to think, teaches you how to analyze, reflect, meaningfully synthesize, etc. and those skills are the kind that make leaders, create change, and actually influence policy."
