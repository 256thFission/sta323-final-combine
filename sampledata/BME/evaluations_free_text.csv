There was no development of skills, there was no development of engineering thought, the way the course was portrayed was as a memorize this style of teaching with fill in the blank notes. No design challenges were levied. there was little that was learned in this course that will help me going forward. I could have learned all of the specifics of each material in a job or a lab setting, and I was hoping that this being an engineering course could be based around thoughtful design, but it was strictly memorization of unimportant details. Three specific things that were memorized were hydrogels, composites, and metals.

That being said, professor Wallace spends very little time on teaching the mathematical aspects of the course and the statistics component is poorly covered. Professor Wallace provides decent resources for self learning but the course is extremely difficult because of the amount of practice you have to do on your own in the math and statistics aspects. This course feels like three classes combined into one (biology, mathematics, and statistics) with only one taught very well and the other two lacking slightly."

If you start doing practice problems thinking that you have to do every single one in order to be prepared, you won't gain anything from doing them.

The workload can get really crazy: some homework sets take 12 hours and some stats modules feel like they take 12 hours. (The stats modules are easily the worst part of this class, and I found them (while important) to be really exhausting and mind-numbing. Conceptually, if you are interested in physiology, the lectures will actually be sort of fun. Its not horrible to understand, but when you get stuck with homework, stats, and a lab in the same week, things can get really, really, dire.Also, I hope you have an I-pad, as without one you end up printing so so so much. I lug around about a whole ream of paper worth of printed lectures at all times, and I have actively spent an unfortunate amount of my personal money at the printer. If you were on the fence about getting an I-pad, it might genuinely be worth it for this class. You'd be fine without one though, I mean, I was :)All in all, this class is very rewarding. I feel like I have learned so much, and I feel pretty prepared for the future.

I really liked the module style teaching that went through how all of the tools worked and how to best design devices. I feel that I learned a lot of real world skills in the class. The flexibility in the class and his willingness to answer questions truly made a great environment.

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","It was helpful to do practice problems in class and to have the problem solving sessions on Thursdays. However, sometimes the PSS felt a little to abstract or too different than what we'd seen before. In terms of the PBL, it was a little difficult to only have one meeting a week with our instructor to help answer questions. Office hours were great though but that required one to go themselves rather than a forced time to meet together. I also appreciated how available Saterbak was. She did truly try to help but it was kind of a lost cause because I just didn't understand how to effectively make a model. It also felt like the material we learned in lecture did not translate to the PBL. We would have very specific and controlled problems on our homework and were then expected to apply these equations and skills to a model that was not biologically accurate and essentially made up."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","The instructor separated the whole curriculum into modules, which I found to be an organized way to keep track of my learning. She also assigned two types of worksheets: math and coding, which I also found helpful as I could focus on each aspect separately. She would also teach for a bit, and then have us practice in groups which was effective in solidifying my understanding. I also found the public exam structure very useful because it tested me on my ability to apply concepts rather than just knowing them."

He has been a fantastic teacher who genuinely cares about the success of his students and really takes the time to get to know them. He is continuously asking for feedback on how he can make his class better which I appreciate. Weekly quizzes on canvas that are low stakes really help solidify my understanding in a low pressure way and encourage actually learning.

It was also just fun to hang with the other BMEs and the lab staff. I thought the homeworks were more effective before the switch to flipped classroom, because they were more in-depth and required us to actually review the content at a different timepoint, rather than just answering problems together off the slides on basically the day after watching the lecture. I also enjoyed reading papers and getting key takeaways from those, and overall the course content itself was super interesting.

Please describe three specific things you learned.","BME 307 provided an excellent combination of physiology and engineering. What I enjoyed most was truly seeing the clinical applications of class material, through computer projects such as designing a shunt to avoid wall shear stress. I gained skills in mathematical computation, putting math in the context of the body, and brainstorming methods to use equations in ways I hadn't previously used them. Three specific things I learned are: 
1. Every patient is unique, down the deformability of their blood cells. This may seem obvious, but simply learning about hematocrit levels and understanding how even a slight variation in hematocrit can result in drastic changes in blood fluid mechanics was impactful. When it comes to patient care, the individual patient must be treated as such, taking into account the geometry of their unique vessels and the properties of their blood. 
2. Mathematical analysis can be infinitely complicated; in clinical settings, it is sometimes acceptable to make simplifications/assumptions to simplify computation, but it is very important to understand where these assumptions come from and when they are valid.
3. I learned the impact that computational visualizations have on the field of medicine and healthcare. Physicians can not make very important decisions without the correct tools to visualize their surgical plans and apply these plans to individual patients."

I also really liked the format for the homework and quizzes, where we had homework quizzes. I think a lot of times in other classes, if we just have homework, we kind of j slave thru it j for the sake of having it done to turn in and get a grade for it and don't thinl too much when there is small stuff confusing us.

This has been one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Duke. I've definitely struggled but I loved how this class challenged me to think at a deeper level than other classes. I don't approach each problem set or exam problem worried about getting the answer right, but rather enjoying the process of being wrong and then thinking harder to truly understand the content. This class made me enjoy learning for the sake of learning and enjoying what I learn, not learning just to pass or do well on exams."

Come into class on Fridays, come to lab prepared, i.e read through the lab manual, have a pretty solid idea of what you are going to do. Communicate with your lab partner, try to meet in person to get work done. Consider signing up for the later lab if you can. 1) 8:30 is too early to be thinking about circuits. 2) sometimes, I think there were some things the people in the morning section struggled with that were mostly sorted out by the time we got there in the afternoon. I don't think it is too big of a deal though."

The teaching efficiency and utility of content and infectious enthusiasm of it is something I never expected from a class; you can tell a lot of thought was put into it, and Dr. Chatterjee is the perfect person to teach it. As he says, it gives you a toolbox and way of thinking that will get you far with a lot of molecular engineering problems. If no changes are made, think of office hours as part of the class (the weeks when problem sets are due). This is coming from a junior who barely ever went to office hours before. It's actually not much work for the amount of learning at all, so don't stress and just follow the advice of the teaching team."

One reason for this is that I took supporting machine learning classes (CS390) during the semester. I saw a lot of overlap and that CS390 course went into depth, which helped fill the gaps in my understanding. For an emerging topic, I really think covering a lot of topics and letting students do more of their own research is a rather effective strategy. This also allows you to be more relevant in the topics by spending less depth into a topic."

The 50 minute class length vs 75 minute length allowed way more topics to be covered. Moreover, it helped give us, in essence, a crash course a variety of topics. It could be more intellectually stimulating if the labs had more post hoc testing, seeing more examples of what went wrong by using this model, comparing it to using another good model. Some questions were asked, but they were more theoretical. Moreover, I think an open ended project in lieu of a final exam would be more stimulating."

The dry labs are outlined very well and provide a lot of guidance while still making you think and figure out the information on your own.
The problem sets are designed to apply the concepts you learned in class instead of just repeating information. This can be hard but it certainly makes you think about the concepts in a more useful way."

His lectures get into the bigger picture of biotech, which feels like an excellent capstone to all the more granular classes I've taken. He went through the whole bench-to-bedside process of drug development while also supplementing with interesting guest speakers and field trips to a GMP facility and the cellular processing development facility. He also talked about bioethics a lot, as well as just general career and life advice for moving forward in biotech. I feel like this prepared me very well to be a leader in the field in the future. Dr. Kim clearly cares so much about our development as scientists and people, and I feel like he cares a lot that we leave Duke BME armed with both technical skills and human-centered practices. In class, and especially in lab, he facilitates a low-pressure and friendly learning environment where everyone is comfortable being confused and asking questions, which has helped me learn SO much over my years working in the teaching lab. He also gives good feedback on design pitches and proposals.Shoutout also to the teaching lab staff. Maggie and Melanie (and Matt and Lizzie, although they weren't involved with this class) are SUCH a huge asset to the department. They know everything and are so willing to help.

It's amazing to me how poor this class was run, with the initial weeks forcing students to think of an unsolved problem in the BME space to create a solution within less than a year. These unsolved problems require more extensive backgrounds of electrical and mechanical systems to better propose solutions that could be implemented. We don't need to go through Pugh scoring matrices and create 50 ideas, 45 of which are just to submit the assignment. There's also no need to spend weeks on creating a narrative and ensuring that the problem we propose to tackle is valid. This course was just self driven, so you gained stuff from what you put into it. So personally, I learned a lot as I wanted to go down a specific pathway, however, Dr. Kyle made it clear that this method wouldn't work out and that we should scrap it, after we informed him (and he agreed) that we could continue on this path. Frustrating for sure, but not a conducive environment for learning and developing new skills. Not only that, but when wanting to apply to engineering jobs next semester, it would've been super helpful to develop some skills. However, when Dr. Kyle constantly bats everything down and constantly gives us negative feedback with no positive remarks, it leads you to be unmotivated and disinterested in the course."

Please describe three specific things you learned.","There are numerous significant problems with BME 473 that I will enumerate throughout my course evaluation, and I trust that my word will be taken seriously.Truthfully, I did not develop any new skills, insights, or ways of thinking in BME 473. Most of the lecture time was spent teaching the foundations of the Engineering Design Process, which is a fundamental framework that I internalized in EGR 101 - the first engineering course I took at Duke. Before starting BME 473, I had already learned how to define a problem, formulate a need statement, outline stakeholders, explain functional requirements, understand constraints, build a proof of principle, screen solution ideas, construct scoring matrices for quantitative decision-making, and deliver effective presentations. We spent excessive time reviewing these basic engineering topics in the class, which subtracted from time that could be spent working towards a solution. I genuinely do not understand the need for such a comprehensive review of EGR 101 topics, and the result of this wasted time will be evident in the fidelity of every group's final project. In fact, Dr. Kyle has recommended targeting a low or medium fidelity prototype as the final product. This indicates that our EGR 101 final products and our BME 473 final products will roughly have the same fidelity, which is concerning given the difference in principle between those two courses.Naturally, this course has felt like a waste of time. I will say that I gained new knowledge, but this is only due to research conducted on our specific design problem. Given that any design course would entail such research, I think it is fair to conclude that BME 473 offers almost no unique benefits as a course; it only facilitates a design project, and it even accomplishes that poorly. In reality, the course structure of BME 473 has simply taught me to diminish my expectations for the ""senior design"" experience."

Are there specific course components or methods of instruction you’d keep for future years?","No learning was facilitated. I was unmotivated to learn because of the negative feedback on every assignment. You'd have one positive conversation with a clear path to victory, and weeks later, it is thwarted with Dr. Kyle not believing in the method you proposed. To go through an entire two-month period with little to no communication from Dr. Kyle and then end the final presentation with not a single positive comment is pretty unfortunate. I like to think of learning being facilitated by your ability to be an effective professor who guides your students toward a problem and ensures that they are not only meeting all of the goals you set up in the semester but also that they are learning along the way. Dr. Kyle did neither. Not only this, lecture time was supposed to be dedicated towards working to idea research or to devise solutions. Instead, Dr. Kyle lectured about everything in EGR101! This class was a prerequisite for all of engineering! It isn't necessary to reiterate this, mostly because of the inability to cover all of this within a short enough fashion to still allow for a fully fleshed out solution to be created. I think the whole idea of trying to stimulate our minds to be better entrepreneurs, and instead of devising the technologies we should attempt to find a problem first is an amazing concept to be learned, but in graduate school. I think for the undergrads, its more important to hone in on the soft skills, such as CAD, ECAD, circuit design, electrical testing, and firmware development to be able to go into an engineering job and tackle whatever project assigned on the first day. If I'm prompted to instead research potential solutions, and then whenever I come up with said articles to share it immediately gets batted down, it leads to an environment that nobody can thrive in."

I get it; they are necessary to the design engineering process, and we must understand them. However, it is also the most tedious part of engineering when it is drawn out over months without any tangible exercises or hands-on application. I felt that by having us complete extensive assignments on it, I was either stretched thin to complete a little bit of everything on a project assignment or worked on writing 6 pages on one part of the assignment and never got the big picture learning of the entire design process. I think there are ways we can limit the amount of lecture time in class, and increase the amount of group project work time with individual check-ins from more professional engineers beyond Dr. Kyle - we would have loved to bounce one-off questions and ideate with other people like TAs or lab managers like Matt Brown who can offer their expertise as well."

""flipped classroom"" model has been watching 4 lectures outside of class to be given the final 15 minutes of class to work on something unrelated to our teams progress. If you're going to design this course as a flipped classroom model, lean into it. 2. start the class by giving us some mini-project assignments to introduce us to some skills and technologies that typical design projects may use. what has ended up happening is that people who like coding have given themselves coding projects, people who like CAD have given themselves CAD projects, and people who like circuits have given themselves circuitry projects. Nobody is developing any skills. 3. reward hard work... this is the only class I've taken where the professor keeps moving the goalposts. we've asked for Dr. Kyle's feedback both before and after assignments. somehow, his feedback always changes. one day he'll tell us to move forward with something and then next day he'll tell us that was a bad idea."

A significant bit of lecture time was taken up by topics that have been covered in short pre-recorded videos. One thing that I found made this class stimulating was bringing in outside speakers to discuss their problems, but that only happened once. While those projects did not interest my group, it's quite possible that others might have. In a course where many of the problems are student-defined, it's difficult to find an actual need that hasn't already been solved, but can also be accomplished within the time constraints of this sequence. More problems being presented could have helped that."

Topics such as PCB design, signal processing, different types of microcontrollers, or other electrical engineering topics would have been much more stimulating. As a BME senior design course, it should involve teaching how to integrate the knowledge I have gained from my previous BME courses into a complete design. It should not be a rehashing of EGR 101, but limited even further by the narrow scope of allowed projects. More time to prototype would have been appreciated. I would like to point out that the course is designated as an IM (medical imaging) area elective, even though nothing taught in the course was related to medical imaging."

I expected this class to teach me how to identify a problem. I expected this class to teach me how to thoroughly and methodically design something to solve a problem. Neither of these happened. While I wish I learned engineering concepts, the class still would have been stimulating had it been on a problem that mattered to me. But once again, we weren’t provided with the tools for idea generation or filtering. Student-proposed ideas seemed to be put down."

I liked how we devoted a substantial chunk of the first half of the semester to design research. It was critical to have an understanding of the disease statement fundamentals as well as an overview of the existing treatments in the market.
Designing our own PoP testing plan was also quite challenging, and required students to stay organized when compiling information from the literature."

I found myself not receiving helpful or actionable feedback from instructors on how to go about developing or testing potential solutions beyond combing through the literature. I feel that one thing that could really improve the student experience for next semester would be to have enough TAs such that one TA could be assigned to each student group. At this point, we know there are 8 student teams, and we know what problem they are working on. Thus, it would be extremely helpful to have a TA with background knowledge relevant to the problem who can provide technical assistance to teams on an individual basis, this would allow for teams to get feedback during every class session: during this semester, Dr. Kyle would go around talking with teams, but there would not be enough time for him to catch up with all teams during class. Thus, I think this change could improve engagement with the course."

It was only intellectually stimulating when we opted to go down the path that Dr. Kyle and us agreed upon, only for it to lead to him saying that we shouldn't go down this path anymore. Other than that, it was everything I hated from EGR101 on steroids and with considerably more subjective grading. There are some 'sunshine' projects in the class that seem to be doing much better because they're able to make more tangible progress throughout the semester while you have other groups screening for cancer!?!?! How is the grading supposed to be consistent throughout all of the different groups, especially when you first have to verify your every move with Dr. Kyle? There is no room for creative freedom in this course, and I understand that Dr. Kyle can't just let us go down a rabbit hole of complete nonsense, but if it's for the greater good of us to understand the engineering design process and develop new skills, why wouldn't we opt to have a structure that is a little looser? By constantly going back and forth with Dr. Kyle, you lose a lot of this intellectual stimulation because you're instead choosing to do the thing that will earn you a better grade in the course instead of learning."
BME-473L-001_Kyle__Aaron_Fall_2023.html,Fall 2023,BME-473L-001 : MEDICAL DEVICE DESIGN I.BME-473L-001.,Aaron Kyle,4,What made this class stimulating or how could it be more intellectually stimulating if it wasn’t?,"This class was not intellectually stimulating - let me lay out some further complaints with the specific class structure (really an extension of the previous question).3. Dr. Kyle's grading policies are ambiguous to the point where they are unhelpful. Additionally, individual assignment grades are locked to 85%, 90%, or 97%, which is a practice I have never seen before.A big issue with BME 473 is the ambiguity of the grading guidelines. For each assignment, Dr. Kyle publishes a set of guidelines for achieving an LP, P, or HP grade. Though I would normally refer to this as a rubric, Dr. Kyle has specified that these guidelines are not rubrics. Frequently, there is no explicit distinction between the P and HP guidelines; that choice is entirely up to Dr. Kyle. Although Dr. Kyle is aware about this ambiguity, it seems to be a point of pride in the course structure rather than an issue in his eyes. This lack of clarity has consequences on the assignment grades, but the implications stretch beyond just the grade. For example, two groups with different interpretations of assignment guidelines may put entirely different levels of effort towards an assignment. Yet, they emerge with the same grade for both assignments, and this has happened repeatedly. This clearly demonstrates a bad return on investment for the group that worked harder on the assignment. In my opinion, such inconsistencies are a sign of a poorly constructed grading policy.4. The workload in this class is not justifiable given the slow pace of solution development.I believe BME 473 has exhibited the lowest return on investment of any BME class I’ve taken. Many weeks, our group is tasked with writing up 30-40 page documents (which seems to usually be skimmed), yet only a small fraction of this information has been relevant in our final project. The hefty workload of the original design research assignments was understandably an intentionally structured component of the course, and I acknowledge the value in establishing a wide breadth of design research. However, this philosophy did not cooperate well with Dr. Kyle’s tendency to oppose students’ ideas. The result was that we did excessive amounts of research, yet Dr. Kyle invalidated most of it after skimming our homework assignments in minutes. It would have been far more beneficial to everyone if we could have filtered these ideas before writing pages of research on them.
 
I do not think grading should be controlled by one single authority. The subjectivity that has governed the grading system of this class should not be in the hands of one person, especially with all the issues I've posed with BME 473. Maybe it would be helpful to loop Matt Brown in on grading, as he is a consultant for the course.I think serious attention should be paid to student-professor interactions in this course. Most of my negative attitude towards this class has spawned from my interactions with the professor. I don't want to recommend any specific changes in this area, but I strongly believe that the BME department owes its students an improved senior design course.The solution development phase of this course needs to begin much sooner into the semester. In general, the pace of this course was too slow to warrant its heavy workload, as it genuinely feels like we have worked very hard for a very insignificant outcome. The past few weeks have been the most interesting segment of the course, as we were actually allowed to build and test prototypes for our prospective solutions. That proof of principle segment should be a much greater emphasis in BME 473."

We've gone through an entire BME curriculum and it's great to be able to finish it off with a two semester senior capstone rather than a more rushed 1 semester design course. Some of the assignments can be a little tedious, but with a good group it isn't so bad. I also enjoy Dr. Kyle as an instructor and feel that previous course evaluations haven't represented my experience with him. He has really taken the feedback and adjusted the course pacing and assignments to try to get us working in the lab earlier and made assignments less strict / difficult to achieve a good grade on. Dr. Kyle really does care about the success of the students and will often give us suggestions and think about our specific projects over the weekend (like well outside of working hours lol)."

Many of my teachers avoid sharing these resources, likely as a way to encourage attendance, but Dr. Sommer's lectures are so engaging and informative that students want to go to class, and being able to review content afterward only enhances the learning experience and helps me achieve a deeper understanding. I also enjoy that he incorporates a variety of learning modalities—coding, reading primary literature, exploring both historical context and detailed anatomical content—which keeps the material dynamic and intellectually stimulating. Although the use of pop quizzes would typically not seem favorable, I found the way he implements them very positive and successful in encouraging me to consistently review notes, while his flexibility in offering partial and extra credit shows his genuine commitment to student success and learning.

Working on a proposal for a project investigating biomechanics in collegiate softball pitchers, I gained experience in describing study designs, selecting appropriate equipment, and defining experimental protocols for capturing data across different populations. This process developed my understanding of how to frame research questions and justify methods in a way that aligns with both scientific rigor and real-world applications.Another key learning experience came from preparing and delivering presentations on sensors relevant to our proposals. These flash-style presentations emphasized concise communication of key information, which not only helped my peers understand and potentially integrate these tools into their own proposals but also strengthened my ability to synthesize and present technical material effectively. This collaborative approach enhanced the course's interactive and applied nature, as it allowed the class to explore a range of solutions and technologies together.Weekly literature assignments also played a large role in my learning by providing a foundation for understanding the background and context of our chosen topics. These assignments guided us through the process of conducting thorough literature reviews, which were essential for identifying gaps in existing knowledge and setting the stage for our grant proposals. Overall, the course structure—combining proposal writing, presentations, mathematical modeling, and literature analysis—provided a comprehensive learning experience that has prepared me to think critically and contribute meaningfully to scientific research."

I gained a solid understanding of how light propagates in biological tissues, including scattering, absorption, and various modeling techniques such as diffusion theory and the radiative transfer equation. This helps me evaluate the strengths and limitations of different imaging modalities.
2. Interdisciplinary principles of hybrid imaging (UOT and PAT)
I learned how optical and acoustic methods can be integrated, such as using ultrasound to modulate light (UOT) or using light to generate acoustic signals (PAT), which significantly enhances imaging depth and resolution. This interdisciplinary approach has broadened my research perspective.
3. Critical modeling and analytical skills
Through problem sets and paper discussions, I developed skills in modeling light transport in tissues and critically evaluating experimental setups. These analytical skills are essential for conducting and interpreting research in biomedical optics."

The slides were carefully curated and made learning the topics quite easy. Second, the instructor was passionate and engaged with teaching both during the class, where he tried to engage everyone for participation and impart the material in a careful and easy-to-understand way, thanks to his deep understanding and teaching skills, and after class, where he and the TAs were mostly responsive to questions.
The class recordings were invaluable to my learning process, allowing me to revisit and review course materials after each session—I strongly recommend continuing this practice. Regarding quizzes, I would suggest incorporating exercises that require debugging code implementations. Given the potential for hallucinations in LLM models, developing these practical debugging and code comprehension skills would be particularly beneficial for gaining a deeper understanding of correct implementation, especially with more involved requests."

I would have liked to see less lecture time dedicated to help with labs (especially since there is already lab time for that) and instead have lectures that dive deeper into embedded systems concepts - relatedly, I think the git and C lectures could probably be replaced with homework youtube watching, reclaiming that time for more embedded systems topics (for reference I came into the class familiar with git and Python but no C experience)

Its very easy to run into one small problem that can leave your code not functioning, and that can be pretty stressful if you are on a time crunch. Use Dr Palmeri! He is a great resource, and he is great at getting back to you quickly when you have an issue.

Though all the lecturers are excited about explaining their science, a subset of them are better scientists than lecturers. It would be best if the lecturers were made aware or were provided with guidelines stating that their lecture should cover the broad strokes of their field like fundamental principles and techniques, not so much about the details of their particular projects in the lab since that won't make it as broadly applicable to students in the class.

I found the homework assignments appropriately challenging. For most questions, I had to dedicate a fair amount of time to reviewing lecture material, researching online, and trying different approaches, but I never found them impossible or overly frustrating to complete. The group project topic my group selected was well outside of my knowledge base, but I found a niche to occupy and did find I learned a lot about a subject I was previously unfamiliar with (though I suspect the outcomes of this assignment depend strongly on the individual group members).

Technically there's no penalty for not doing this (the projects are graded a bit leniently), but if you're taking this course you're probably interested in it, and you will get so much more out of the course if you do. The more work you put into your projects early on and consistently, the more ambitious you can be when working on cutting edge topics, and you'll really just disappoint yourself (not your grade) if you end up procrastinating and missing out on making something cool with all the support they give you here."

First, the course content was very relevant to my interests, as well as many other peers in the class.  This is the only course offered at Duke that provides BME students to learn about the complexities of cancer and the biomedical therapeutic applications.  Dr. Misha provided a very in-depth explanation of cancer, and his professional experience offered a unique learning opportunity for me to develop ideas for my own research interests.   While cancer is complex, biomedical engineering is very applicable to the future of treating cancer, so the foundation set by Dr. Misha was beyond insightful.  Secondly, I appreciated the opportunity for students to create and present their own presentations that highlighted the diversity of biomedical engineering applications in cancer.  This aspect of the course benefitted me in two ways.  For one, I was able to learn a plethora of applications to cancer treatment including utilizing nanoparticles, bacterial therapy, chemotherapy, combinatory therapies, and more.  Secondly, Dr. Misha established a safe learning environment for us to all build our presentations skills in our field of interest."

This skill is critical in developing an understanding of the problems currently faced in the medical field.
Another key insight I learned in this course is the approach required for pitches to investors for new medical technologies. Specifically, in project 2 I learned a lot about effective communication strategies to different investing parties when pitching a product.
Finally, I felt like I had very little insight into the grant proposal side of medtech prior to this course. Following the final project, I feel like I have started to understand the fundamentals of applying for grants as well as the development of technological significant and innovative research."

2. The engineering (or electrical) aspects of neural systems. I was a neuroscience major and all my understanding for the AP and H-H model was on surface. I knew what they are but didn't know why they are like that. In this course I learnt to understand them in a more engineering way.
3. Application of curve-fitting methods and the Euler's methods."

Much of the start of the course was devoted to how the behavior of neural cell membranes is analogous to and can be modeled by RC circuits, with this model being expanded throughout the course. 
The next section of the course was heavily devoted to discussing ion flow dynamics and how ion concentration changes coincide with the firing of action potentials. 
The last section of the course provided an overview of the Hodgkin-Huxley experiments, with explanations of the associated models."

The beginning of the course focused in depth on fundamental topics such as dipoles and how electric fields interact. The second portion of the course moved in to how this was related to neurons and gave a great understanding to why ions really move in action potentials and what each step of the H-H models mean. We also learned how several neuron characteristics can be found from the movement of ions such as conduction velocity or signal strength. The last bit of the course also described different action potentials in different kinds of cells in the body, such as cardiomyocytes.

I also liked that the instructor encouraged discussion amongst peers when answering the wooclap questions since talking through problems with other people helps me learn.

I think seminars are most engaging and informative when they are interactive and allow for questions where we can learn from the speaker/student panels. Another course aspect I enjoyed was the lab presentations since it was very helpful to learn what everyone in our cohort is doing for their research. The change to have group presentations with everyone in the same lab presenting at once went really well and made it easy to learn what different labs are working on at Duke BME and see how everyone's personal interests relate to their lab's work. The optional survey for feedback worked well too since I was able to give useful and specific feedback to some presentations and then sometimes I just wanted to listen and ask questions and not have to worry about filling out the survey for every group."
